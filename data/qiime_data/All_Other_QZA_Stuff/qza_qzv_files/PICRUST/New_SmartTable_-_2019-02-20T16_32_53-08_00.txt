"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-7539"	"6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis III (Chlamydia)"	"PWY-7539"	"|FRAME: DIHYDROPTERIN-CH2OH-PP| (6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate) is the pterin precursor for the biosynthesis of several important cofactors, including |FRAME:THF-GLU-N tetrahydrofolate|, |FRAME: CPD-10763| and |FRAME: CPD-10764|.
The compound is always synthesized from GTP, but the enzymes involved may differ among organisms.

This pathway variant has been characterized from |FRAME: TAX-810|, obligate intracellular bacteria that cause a wide variety of infectious diseases in humans and animals. Unlike other intracellular bacteria that salvage |FRAME:THF-GLU-N tetrahydrofolate| or its precursors from their hosts, many Chlamydia species have retained the ability to synthesize folate.

While the |FRAME: PWY-6147 \"cannonical pathway\"|, which is found in most bactreria and in eukaryotes, starts with |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.16|, the Chlamydial pathway variant starts with |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.25|, an enzyme that usually functions in flavin biosynthesis |CITS: [25006229]|.

The product is then isomerized to |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P| by a unique Chlamydial isomerase, encoded by the |FRAME: G-34499| gene. In most organisms this enzyme only catalyzes |FRAME: EC-5.3.1.24|. However, in |FRAME: TAX-810| the enzyme has evolved to afford the additional activity seen in this pathway |CITS: [25006229]|.

The last two steps are identical to the cannonical pathway - the resulting |FRAME: DIHYDRO-NEO-PTERIN| is converted to |FRAME: AMINO-OH-HYDROXYMETHYL-DIHYDROPTERIDINE| by |FRAME: EC-4.1.2.25|, and the last reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.6.3|, which in |FRAME: TAX-810| is a bifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.15|.

The unusual pathway is probably a result of a loss of the |FRAME: EG11375| and |FRAME: G-10191| genes, which encode the enzymes that catalyze the first two steps in the cannonical pathway, and the evolution of other enzymes to fulfill the missing roles."

The acid sugar |FRAME: KDO| (known as Kdo for ketodeoxyoctonate) is a component of bacterial |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides| (LPS) and of the |FRAME: CPD-14581 \"rhamnogalacturonan II\"| (RG-II) pectin fraction of the primary cell walls of most higher plants, including dicots, monocots and gymnosperms |CITS:[York85][7958328][shin97][9779594]|.

The number of Kdo units in bacterial polysaccharides vary, depending on the species, but the majority of Gram-negative bacteria contain at least one Kdo molecule in their LPS.
To date, the specific contribution of Kdo to RG-II function in plants remains largely unknown. 

Kdo needs to be activated prior to its incorporation into the polymers. This activation occurs through the unusual coupling of Kdo to the monophosphonucleotide CMP |CITS:[11050325]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Despite incorporating Kdo into very different macromolecules, the Kdo biosynthesis and activation pathway is almost completely conserved between plants and bacteria |CITS: [23974348]|. 

The pathway starts with the isomerization of |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| to |FRAME: ARABINOSE-5P|, followed by its conversion to |FRAME: KDO-8P| (KDOP), which is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.55|| (KDOPS). The bacterial KDOPSs have been grouped in two classes, and plant KDOPSs belong to a third class |CITS:[15070398]|.

In the next step the phosphate group is removed from |FRAME: KDO-8P|, generating Kdo. This is catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.45|. It should be noted that the plant enzyme responsible for this dephosphorylation has not been identified yet.

The last step of the pathway is the activation of Kdo to |FRAME: CMP-KDO|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.38|."

In eukaryotes, |FRAME:MANNOSE| is a key monosaccharide for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids.

Mannose-containing glycoconjugates, such as protein <i>N-</i> and <i>C-</i>glycans, some
<i>O</i>-glycans, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein membrane anchors, and some glycolipids,
have a variety of important functions. These functions include the promotion of correct folding, solubility,
stability and intracellular sorting of proteins, promoting the enzymatic, hormonal or receptor activity of
many proteins, and the formation of cell surface glycocalyces, extracellular matrices and protective cell
walls. In addition, glycoproteins are known to play major roles in cell-cell interactions
(see |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS|) |CITS: [11447107]|.

|FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| is the critical metabolite of the mannose activation pathway for
glycoconjugate synthesis in eukaryotes, as it is utilized directly or indirectly as a mannose donor for all
mannosylation reactions.

In addition, |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| is a precursor for the biosynthesis of several important
compounds, including |FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE| (see |FRAME: PWY-66|)

|FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides Lipopolysaccharides| (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A \"lipid A\"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; core oligosaccharide, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.

The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria.

Gram-positive bacteria and Archaea do not have a lipopolysaccharide. Instead they possess the S-layer (surface layer) as a component of the cell envelope |CITS: [11742749][1938891]|. The S-layer is composed of a single layer of identical proteins or glycoproteins that form a two-dimensional, monomolecular crystalline array |CITS:[7934867]|. Structurally, S-layer glycoproteins from Gram-positive bacteria resemble the O-antigens of Gram-negative organisms, and often contain similar modified sugar building blocks |CITS: [11741945]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

A group of 6-deoxyhexoses, including |FRAME: CPD-13559|, |FRAME: CPD-15612|, |FRAME: CPD-13829|, |FRAME: CPD-9388|, |FRAME: CPD0-1107| and |FRAME: CPD-15615| are used as components of the O-anigen repeating units in lipopolysaccharides of certain Gram-negative bacteria and of the S-layer of some Gram-positive bacteria.

All of these modified sugar residues are synthesized in a GDP nucleotide-activated form from |FRAME: GLC-6-P| via |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|. 

Mannose is produced in its 6-phosphate form by the isomerization of |FRAME:GLC-6-P| via |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| This is achieved by the action of the ubiquitous |FRAME: EC-5.3.1.9|, which also participates in glycolysis, and the more specific |FRAME: EC-5.3.1.8| |CITS: [1846611]|. In order to produce the activated mannose donor |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| the 6-phosphate is first reconstructed as a 1-phosphate form, followed by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.13| |CITS:[GaoIntJMassSpec05] [8922954]|.

Before |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE| can be converted to the other sugars, it loses the the hydroxyl group connected to carbon 6 by the action of |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.47|, producing |FRAME: GDP-4-DEHYDRO-6-DEOXY-D-MANNOSE| |CITS: [14739333]|. This compound is the substrate for several different enzymes, including dehydrogenases, aminotransferases, and dehydratases, resulting in the production of the different modified 6-deoxysugars shown in this pathway."

For example, it is the terminal saccharide of the tetrasaccharide attached to the surface (S)-layer glycoprotein Asn-498 of the halophilic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2246| |CITS: [22029420][24194539][24831810]|.
Some bacteria such as the actinomycete |FRAME: TAX-60894| also utilize |FRAME: CPD0-1112| as a component of secondary metabolites (see |FRAME: PWY-7100| for an example) |CITS: [11544225 ]| |CITS: [19126547]|.

Like most deoxysugars, |FRAME: CPD0-1112| is synthesized in the activated form of a nucleotide sugar - |FRAME: DTDP-RHAMNOSE|. However, at least in some plants, such as mung bean (|FRAME: TAX-157791|), both |FRAME: DTDP-RHAMNOSE| and |FRAME: UDP-L-RHAMNOSE| act as sugar donors for the rhamnosylation of flavonoids |CITS: [13864832 ]|.

Biosynthesis starts with |FRAME: GLC-1-P|, which is activated by |FRAME: TTP| and converted to |FRAME: DTDP-DEOH-DEOXY-GLUCOSE| in two steps. The first enzyme of the pathway, RmlA (RfbA) (|FRAME: EC-2.7.7.24 \"EC 2.7.7.24\"|), catalyzes the transfer of a thymidylmonophosphate nucleotide to |FRAME: GLC-1-P| |CITS: [11053865]|. The second enzyme, RmlB (|FRAME: EC-4.2.1.46 \"EC 4.2.1.46\"|), catalyzes the oxidation of the C4 hydroxyl group of the sugar, followed by dehydration |CITS: [10666612][11243820]|. These two steps are common in the synthesis of many modified sugars used for O-antigen synthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-7317|).

|FRAME: DTDP-DEOH-DEOXY-GLUCOSE| is then converted to |FRAME:DTDP-DEOH-DEOXY-MANNOSE| by the action of  RmlC (|FRAME: EC-5.1.3.13 \"EC 5.1.3.13\"|) |CITS: [10089454][10802738]|. In most organisms this enzyme only participates in |FRAME: CPD0-1112| production, although in some streptomyces species it also participates in synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-15496| (see |FRAME: PWY-7301|) |CITS: [15752721]|.

The final enzyme of this pathway, |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.133|, reduces the carbon at the 4th position, resulting in |FRAME: CPD0-1112| |CITS: [10666586]|.

The pathway is ubiquitous and highly conserved in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is also found in plants, fungi, and lower eukaryotes |CITS: [27009306]|. The last two enzymatic activities (epimerase and reductase) are performed in plants by one bifunctional enzyme, NRS/ER |CITS: [15020741]|."

The net is made of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads consisting of alternating |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (GlcNAc) and |FRAME: CPD-19950| (MurNAc) sugars, which are held together by small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.

Gram-negative bacteria recycle a very large proportion of the peptidoglycan polymer during normal growth in a process termed cell wall recycling. For example, the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562| recycles about half of its cell wall within one generation |CITS: [18535144][23163477]|.

During this process anhydromuropeptides (mainly |FRAME: CPD0-1080|), which are steadily released during growth by lytic transglycosylases and endopeptidases, are imported back into the cytoplasm by the |FRAME: EG12183|-encoded |FRAME: AMPG-MONOMER|.
Once inside the cytoplasm, the anhydromuropeptides are hydrolyzed by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.28| (|FRAME: EG10041|), |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.52| (|FRAME: G6567|) and |FRAME: EC-3.4.17.13| (|FRAME: G6621|), yielding |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD0-882|, |FRAME: L-ALA-GAMMA-D-GLU-DAP| and |FRAME: D-ALANINE| |CITS: [    3891732]|.

|FRAME: CPD0-882| is phosphorylated by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.170| (|FRAME: G6880|) and then converted into |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P| by |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.126| (|FRAME: G7263|). This is a branch point, as this compound could be directed either for further degradation (see pathways of |FRAME: N-Acetylglucosamine-Degradation|) or for recycling into new peptidoglycan monomers, as described in this pathway |CITS: [15901686][15983044]|.
The final product of this pathway, |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYLMURAMATE|, is one of the precursors for peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

The tripeptide |FRAME: L-ALA-GAMMA-D-GLU-DAP|, which is generated by |FRAME: EC-3.4.17.13|, can be degraded further, as described in |FRAME: PWY0-1546|. However, the vast majority is recycled by muropeptide ligase (|FRAME: EG12440|). This enzyme is a dedicated recycling enzyme that attaches the recovered Ala-Glu-DAP tripeptide to |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYLMURAMATE|, thereby substituting three amino acid ligases of the peptidoglycan <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [8808921]|.

Although exogenously provided |FRAME: CPD0-882| can be taken up by |FRAME:TAX-562|, it can not serve as the sole source of carbon for growth, suggesting that it may be toxic to the cell |CITS: [16452451]|."

|FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| (also known as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, or GGPP) is a
crucial compound involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of terpenes and terpenoids, including
central compounds such as ubiquinones and menaquinones.

In plants, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of essentail
compounds such as chlorophylls, carotenoids, tocopherols, plastoquinones, and gibberellins
|CITS:[12427975]|, as well as a variety of secondary metabolites.

In addition, GGPP is also used in posttranslational modifications of proteins (geranylgeranylation) which
is important for membrane adhesion as well as the function of some proteins |CITS:[11500541][16183844]|.

GGPP is synthesized from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| either by dedicated enzymes,
such as the |FRAME: YPL069C-MONOMER| of |FRAME: TAX-4932|, or by the action of polyprenyl
transferases such as the |FRAME: MONOMER-13766| from |FRAME: TAX-1061| or
|FRAME: CPLX0-7426| from |FRAME: TAX-83333|.
It should be noted that the building blocks for |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP|
are synthesized in different organisms by different pathways. While most eukaryotes and some
bacteria use the |FRAME: PWY-922|, most bacteria, as well as green algae utilize the
|FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| (as described in the two superpathways |FRAME: PWY-5910| and
|FRAME: PWY-5121|).

In plants, GGPP is synthesized using both routes - in the cytosol using the |FRAME: PWY-922|,
and in the plastids using the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY|.

This superpathway describes the production of GGPP via the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY|.

In plants, plastidic GGPP is a central metabolite, involved in the biosythesis of a variety of compounds
(see list given above)."

Menaquinones (MK) and demethylmenaquinones (DMK) are low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane, found in many bacterial species.  These quinones function as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.
Menaquinones have also been implicated in regulation, as they are necessary for sporulation and proper regulation of cytochrome formation in some Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [4353869][4202999]|.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone and/or demethylmenaquinones as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, contain ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|. The main difference between
these quinone molecules is their redox potential. For example, the redox potential for ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone has been measured as +112 mv, +36 mv, and -74 mv, respectively, in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-729| |CITS: [187454]|.

Menaquinones are considered a vitamin (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), since they are essential for animals, mostly for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Animals can not synthesize menaquinones, but usually receive a sufficient amount from bacteria growing in their intestines. In the absence of menaquinone or the related compound |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) which is synthesized in plants, animals suffer from hemorrhage |CITS: [Dam35]|. Menaquinone was first isolated from putrefied fish meal by McKee in 1939 |CITS: [17783315]|, and its structure resolved in 1958 |CITS: [Isler58]|.

The biosynthesis of menaquinones is essentially identical to that of demethylmenaquinones, with one additional step, comprising the addition of a methyl group to the naphthoquinone ring. Many bacterial species do not have this methylase and produce demethylmenaquinone as their sole quinone |CITS: [7022156]|.

All three quinones are synthesized from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, an intermediate of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. However, the pathways of (demethyl)menaquinone synthesis diverts from that for ubiquinones early on.
Most organisms synthesize their menaquinones via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|, although some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-1902| and |FRAME: TAX-274|, synthesize menaquinones in alternative pathways, via |FRAME: CPD-10477| or |FRAME: CPD-13324| |CITS: [18801996][21489995][23972005]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

In this pathway menaquinone is synthesized from chorismate via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|. In a series of reactions, |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE| is converted to the two-ring compound |FRAME: DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE| via several intermediates that include |FRAME: O-SUCCINYLBENZOATE|. At this point a prenyltransferase enzyme attaches a polyprenyl tail to form |FRAME: Demethylmenaquinones|, which can be converted to |FRAME: Menaquinones| by a
dedicated methylase.

Demethylmenaquinones with a side chain of 8 isoprenyl units (DMK-8) have been detected mainly in facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, mostly belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-91347| order (|FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: TAX-548|, |FRAME: TAX-554|, |FRAME: TAX-584|, and |FRAME: TAX-585|) |CITS:[11945333][4886765][4900998][4100202][4148761]|, but also outside that group, as in the case of |FRAME: TAX-644| |CITS: [4886765]|. However, DMK-8 has also been reported from the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1351| |CITS: [14321383][118232 ][11722738]|.

Interestingly, most of these organisms produce not only DMK-8 but also |FRAME: UBIQUINONE-8| and |FRAME: CPD-9728|. Since their redox potential is different, each of these electron transfer agents appear to be best suited for specific growth conditions, and having all three maximizes the ability of the organism to adjust to available substrates. It has been suggested that DMK-8 is used for nitrate and |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O| (TMAO) respiration |CITS: [2849923]|, but its role in nitrate respiration has been contested |CITS: [2204318][1444716][7601837]|."

Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, mono- or diphosphorylated forms of pyrimidine nucleotides activate other molecules, as in |FRAME: CMP-KDO|, |FRAME: CPD-12575|, and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.

The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways of pyrimidine nucleotides consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. Salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides, and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways to form other nucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|).However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level. These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA \"TCA cycle\"|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|,
|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (uridine 5'-monophosphate), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7176|).

The first enzyme, |FRAME: EC-6.3.5.5|, forms |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is not only an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis but also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as |FRAME: ARG|, |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| and |FRAME: CANAVANINE|. The pathway continues with the condensation of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| |CITS: [8041358]|. The products is cyclized to
|FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE|, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring.

The next step, the oxidation of |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| to |FRAME: OROTATE| is carried out by different enzymes in different organisms. In general, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi contain class 1  enzymes, which are cytosolic, include |FRAME: FMN| cofators, and use |FRAME: FUM| or NAD(P)+ as electron acceptors (|FRAME: EC-1.3.98.1|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.1.14|, or |FRAME: EC-1.3.1.15|). Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes possess class 2 enzymes, which are membrane bound and use |FRAME: Quinones| as electron acceptor (|FRAME: EC-1.3.5.2 \"EC 1.3.5.2\"|) |CITS: [Jensen98]|.

The final two steps, the condensation of |FRAME: OROTATE| with PRPP forming |FRAME: OROTIDINE-5-PHOSPHATE|
(OMP) followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.10|
and |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.23|. The last step is considered the rate-limiting step of the overall <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides |CITS: [7579161]|.

In plants, the two initial enzymatic reactions of this pathway occur in the plastids, while all of the remaining reactions occur in the cytosol and mitochondria |CITS: [22474184]|. This implies that |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| must be exported from the plastids. A plastidic nucleobase transporter specific for uracil (a precursor for pyrimidine salvage pathways) has been reported |CITS: [22474184]|. Since the reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: DIHYDROOROTOX-MONOMER \"dihydroorotate dehydrogenase\"| occurs in the mitochondria, transporters for both |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| and |FRAME: OROTATE| must exist, although they have not been identified yet.

The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways
as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. Although the enzymatic steps in this pathway are conserved throughout all organisms (with the exception of the oxidation of |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| to |FRAME: OROTATE|), some differences in the enzymes do exist. For example, in plants and bacteria the three steps leading from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| to |FRAME: OROTATE| are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by the single multifunctional |FRAME: CPLX-6703| |CITS: [8619816]|.
Similarly, the last two steps of the pathway are carried out by a bi-functional enzyme (|FRAME: AT3G54470-MONOMER|) in plants and animals |CITS: [2876681][7579161][9878395]| whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for that purpose."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of UMP appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways
as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. The pathway converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|,
|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (UMP), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides.

The enzyme |FRAME: UMPKI-CPLX| catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP. The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named |FRAME: AT5G26667-MONOMER| |CITS: [15604701]|.

The penultimate enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the terminal phosphate of a nucleoside triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside diphosphate - in this case, the
transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP.

Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleotides is possible only at the level of nucleoside triphosphates, by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependent enzyme |FRAME: CTPSYN-CPLX|."

other purines.

In bacteria and archaea |FRAME:IMP| is synthesized from |FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE| in 6 steps, while in eukarya the first two steps are replaced by a single reaction (see |FRAME: PWY-6124|).

The first 4 steps of the bacterial pathway are catalyzed by individual enzymes, and the last two steps are catalyzed by a single multifunctional enzyme, |FRAME: AICARTRANSIMPCYCLO-CPLX|, which is encoded by the |FRAME: EG10795| gene.

Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|).

The distinction between nucleoside degradation and recycling is not always straight forward.
This pathway shares several steps with the pathway |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=HSERMETANA-PWY"	"L-methionine biosynthesis III"	"HSERMETANA-PWY"	"<b>General Background</b>

|FRAME: MET| (Met) is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. In addition to its role in protein biosynthesis, L-methionine is required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines. In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.

Some bacteria can synthesize methionine using organic sulfur through transsulfuration of |FRAME: O-SUCCINYL-L-HOMOSERINE| with |FRAME: CYS| to form |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE|. Cystathionine is then cleaved to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, which is methylated to methionine (see |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [3309561]|. Plants use a modification of this pathway, where |FRAME: O-PHOSPHO-L-HOMOSERINE|, instead of |FRAME: O-SUCCINYL-L-HOMOSERINE|, is the intermediate converting homoserine to cystathionine (see |FRAME: PWY-702|).

Other bacteria, as well as yeast and fungi, can use a different route in which they directly assimilate inorganic sulfur by a sulfhydrylation (this pathway). In this route |FRAME: HS|, the final product of microbial sulfate reduction (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|) reacts with <i>O</i>-acetylated homoserine, with replacement of the acetyl group by sulfide to form |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, which is once again methylated to methionine (see |FRAME: PWY-5344|).

Most methanogenic archaea utilize yet a different pathway. While these organisms also use |FRAME: HS| as the sulfur source, the other precursor for |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| production is |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE|, produced from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-7977|).

Methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| is catalyzed by either a cobalamin-independent enzyme (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13 \"EC 2.1.1.13\"|) or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.14 \"EC 2.1.1.14\"|), depending upon the species or growth conditions |CITS: [9409150][12948640]|.


<b>About This Pathway</b>

Organisms for which there is evidence for the existence of a direct sulfhydrylation pathway for methionine biosynthesis include |FRAME:TAX-4932| (reviewed in |CITS: [9409150]|), the spirochete |FRAME: TAX-29508| |CITS: [9440513], [12951250]|, |FRAME:TAX-1423| |CITS: [11832514]|, |FRAME:TAX-92706| |CITS: [7096282], [7275950]|, |FRAME:TAX-1718|
|CITS: [11844756]|, |FRAME:TAX-287| |CITS: [10482527]|, and |FRAME:TAX-303| |CITS: [10482527]|. In these organisms, there is also evidence for the transsulfuration pathway, and the use of one pathway may predominate over the other.
In |FRAME:TAX-562| and other enteric bacteria only the transsulfuration pathway is used (Greene, R.C. in |CITS: [COLISAL]| pp. 542-560).  

The presence of |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.49|, is considered indicative of the presence of a direct sulfhydrylation pathway.

Note that all bacterial methionine biosynthetic pathways involve acylated homoserine. However, the <i>O</i>-acyl group is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast, and most Gram-positive bacteria (see |FRAME: HSERMETANA-PWY|) but a succinyl group in enteric bacteria and some other Gram-negative bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-287| and |FRAME:TAX-303| (this pathway) (|CITS: [10482527][3309561][9409150]|)."

In addition to its role in proteins, L-methionine is required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines.

In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.

Most bacteria, yeast and fungi can directly assimilate inorganic sulfur for the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids.  This pathway depicts such a direct sulfhydrylation pathway for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: MET|.

|FRAME:HOMO-SER| is biosynthesized from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, which is synthesized from |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|, a TCA cycle intermediate. Homoserine is then activated through esterification to form the <i>O</i>-acetyl ester. In most organisms |FRAME: HS|, the final product of sulfate reduction (see |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|), reacts with |FRAME:ACETYLSERINE| generating |FRAME: CYS| (see |FRAME:CYSTSYN-PWY|).
However, in certain organisms, including the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| and certain bacteria, |FRAME: HS| reacts with |FRAME:CPD-667|, replacing the acetyl group and forming |FRAME:HOMO-CYS|. Homocysteine is then methylated to |FRAME: MET| via either a cobalamin-independent enzyme or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme, depending upon the species and growth conditions |CITS: [12948640][9409150]|.

The other route of microbial methionine biosynthesis involves the use of organic sulfur through transsulfuration of <i>O</i>-acylated homoserine with cysteine to form cystathionine (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5347|). Cystathionine is then cleaved to homocysteine, and methylated to methionine |CITS: [3309561]|.

Organisms for which there is evidence for the existence of a direct sulfhydrylation pathway for methionine biosynthesis include  |FRAME: TAX-4932| |CITS: [9409150]|, the spirochete |FRAME: TAX-29508| |CITS: [9440513][12951250]|, |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [11832514]|, |FRAME: TAX-92706| |CITS: [7096282][7275950]|, |FRAME: TAX-1718| |CITS: [11844756]|, |FRAME: TAX-287| |CITS: [10482527]|, and |FRAME: TAX-303| |CITS: [10482527]|.
In most of these organisms, there is also evidence for the transsulfuration pathway, and the use of one pathway may predominate over the other.  In |FRAME: TAX-83333| and other enteric bacteria, only the transsulfuration pathway is used (Greene, R.C. in |CITS: [COLISAL]| pp. 542-560).

The <i>O</i>-acyl group of homoserine is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast and most Gram positive bacteria, or a succinyl group in enteric bacteria, as well as |FRAME: TAX-287| and |FRAME: TAX-303| |CITS:[10482527][3309561][9409150]|."

In addition to its role in proteins, L-methionine is required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines.

In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.

This superpathway describes the biosynthesis of the amino acid |FRAME: MET| via the transsulfuration pathway.

|FRAME:HOMO-SER| is biosynthesized from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, which is synthesized from |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|, a TCA cycle intermediate. Homoserine is then activated through esterification to form the <i>O</i>-succinyl ester. In the next step, the enzyme |FRAME:O-SUCCHOMOSERLYASE-ENZRXN| catalyzes a transsulfuration of  |FRAME:O-SUCCINYL-L-HOMOSERINE| with |FRAME:CYS| forming |FRAME:L-CYSTATHIONINE|,
which is then cleaved to |FRAME:HOMO-CYS| and methylated to |FRAME: MET| |CITS: [3309561]|. The methylation can be catalyzed by either a cobalamin-independent enzyme or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme, depending upon the species and growth conditions |CITS: [12948640][9409150]|.

The other route of microbial methionine biosynthesis involves the use of inorganic sulfur via sulfhydrylation of |FRAME:CPD-667| with |FRAME: HS|, forming |FRAME:HOMO-CYS| which is methylated to |FRAME: MET| (see |FRAME:PWY-5345|).

The <i>O</i>-acyl group of homoserine is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast and most Gram positive bacteria, or a succinyl group in enteric bacteria, as well as |FRAME: TAX-287| and |FRAME: TAX-303| |CITS:[10482527][3309561][9409150]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY"	"L-methionine biosynthesis I"	"HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY"	"<b>General Background</b>

|FRAME: MET| (Met) is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. In addition to its role in protein biosynthesis, L-methionine is required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines. In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.

Some bacteria can synthesize methionine using organic sulfur through transsulfuration of |FRAME: O-SUCCINYL-L-HOMOSERINE| with |FRAME: CYS| to form |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE|. Cystathionine is then cleaved to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, which is methylated to methionine (this pathway) |CITS: [3309561]|. Plants use a modification of this pathway, where |FRAME: O-PHOSPHO-L-HOMOSERINE|, instead of |FRAME: O-SUCCINYL-L-HOMOSERINE|, is the intermediate converting homoserine to cystathionine (see |FRAME: PWY-702|).

Other bacteria, as well as yeast and fungi, can use a different route in which they directly assimilate inorganic sulfur by a sulfhydrylation (see |FRAME:HSERMETANA-PWY|). In that route |FRAME: HS|, the final product of microbial sulfate reduction (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|) reacts with <i>O</i>-acetylated homoserine, with replacement of the acetyl group by sulfide to form |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, which is once again methylated to methionine (see |FRAME: PWY-5344|).

Most methanogenic archaea utilize yet a different pathway. While these organisms also use |FRAME: HS| as the sulfur source, the other precursor for |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| production is |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE|, produced from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-7977|).

Methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| is catalyzed by either a cobalamin-independent enzyme (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13 \"EC 2.1.1.13\"|) or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.14 \"EC 2.1.1.14\"|), depending upon the species or growth conditions |CITS: [9409150][12948640]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

While many organisms seem to contain both routes for methionine biosynthesis, in |FRAME:TAX-562| and other enteric bacteria only the transsulfuration pathway is used (Greene, R.C. in |CITS: [COLISAL]| pp. 542-560).  Published evidence for these pathways includes gene identification; complementation of known mutants; analysis of mutant phenotypes; and gene cloning, expression, and enzyme activity assays.
The presence of |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.49| was considered indicative of the presence of a direct sulfhydrylation pathway.

Note that all bacterial methionine biosynthetic pathways involve acylated homoserine. However, the <i>O</i>-acyl group is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast, and most Gram-positive bacteria (see |FRAME: HSERMETANA-PWY|) but a succinyl group in enteric bacteria and some other Gram-negative bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-287| and |FRAME:TAX-303| (this pathway) (|CITS: [10482527][3309561][9409150]|)."

In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.

Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway describes the common aerobic route for |FRAME: Heme-b| biosynthesis. This pathway involves the enzymes |FRAME: COPROGENOXI-MONOMER| and |FRAME: MONOMER-17460|, which require moelecular oxygen for their respective reactions.

There are several types of protoporphyrinogen oxidases: in most eukaryotes and many aerobic or facultative bacteria, such as Firmicutes, the enzyme is a FAD-dependent ~55 kDa protein encoded by the |FRAME: BSU10140| gene. A number of &gamma;-proteobacteria, including |FRAME:TAX-562|, have another type of oxidase, a 21 kDa protein encoded by the |FRAME: EG11485| gene. Most archaea and many other bacteria, including the majority of cyanobacteria, have a third version of the enzyme, a 24 kDa protein encoded by |FRAME: G-15222| |CITS: [20823222]|."

including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. 
In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in

Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as
|FRAME: Heme-b|, different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in
modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|,

The protoheme biosynthetic pathway shown here is found in some bacteria (including
|FRAME: TAX-83333|), archaea, and plants. In these organisms the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway
starts with glutamate (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|).

In many other organisms, including animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa (such as the malaria parasite
|FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [15144063]|), and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, the tetrapyrrole
biosynthesis pathway starts with glycine and succinyl-CoA (see |FRAME:PWY-5189|).
Both the glycine and glutamate pathways are present in the chloroplast-containing |FRAME: TAX-3039|
(reviewed in |CITS: [13680202], [15576047], [12051904], [16093570]|).

Both tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways merge at the intermediate |FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE|.
However, a branch point at |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| leads to biosynthesis of different
compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|),
|FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|),
and heme D biosynthesis.
A second branch point at |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| leads to biosynthesis of chlorophyll
in plants and bacteriochlorophyll in photosynthetic bacteria (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).
In eukaryotes, heme biosynthesis spans the mitochondrial (or plastid) and cytosol compartments.

Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins
including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. 
In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in
transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.

Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as
|FRAME: Heme-b|, different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in
modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|,
|FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.

The protoheme biosynthetic pathway shown here is found in animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa
(such as the malaria parasite |FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [15144063]|), and members of the
&alpha;-proteobacteria.  In these organisms the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway starts with glycine
and succinyl-CoA (see |FRAME:PWY-5189|).
In other bacteria (including |FRAME:TAX-562|) and archaea, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis begins with
glutamate instead of glycine (see |FRAME:PWY-5188|). Plants also biosynthesize heme via
glutamate for use in cytochromes and compounds derived from heme. Both the glycine and glutamate pathways are present in the chloroplast-containing |FRAME: TAX-3039| (reviewed in |CITS: [13680202], [15576047], [12051904], [16093570]|).

Both tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways merge at the intermediate |FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE|.
however, a branch point at |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| leads to biosynthesis of different
compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|),
|FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|),
and heme D biosynthesis.

A second branch point at |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| leads to biosynthesis of chlorophyll
in plants and bacteriochlorophyll in photosynthetic bacteria (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).
In eukaryotes, heme biosynthesis spans the mitochondrial (or plastid) and cytosol compartments.

This topic has been reviewed in |CITS: [13680202], [12177321], [16093570]|.    

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This MetaCyc pathway shows many enzymes and genes for heme biosynthesis in |FRAME: TAX-9606| and the photosynthetic purple nonsulfur &alpha;-proteobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1063|.

|FRAME: TAX-1063| possesses two chromosomes and five additional replicons. Two genes encoding 5-aminolevulinate synthase, <i>hemA</i> and <i>hemT</i>, are present on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. Biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole cofactors heme, bacteriochlorophyll, siroheme and cobalamin in this organism is highly regulated and is dependent upon expression of these two isozymes (in |CITS: [7592416], [10491185]|). The <i>hemA</i> gene product is expressed under normal aerobic and photosynthetic conditions, under which the <i>hemT</i> gene product is not expressed. No activity could be demonstrated for the purified, recombinant <i>hemT</i> gene product <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [10491185]|. 

In |FRAME: TAX-1063|, no <i>hemD</i> gene encoding uroporphyrinogen III synthase has been identified. A 
gene encoding coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (oxygen-dependent) has been identified as <i>hemF</i> and has amino acid sequence similarities to the eukaryotic enzyme. However, oxygen-independent 
(anaerobic) <i>hemN</i> and <i>hemZ</i> encoded forms of the enzyme also exist in this organism, and there is 
evidence that these two alleles were duplicated |CITS: [15028685]|. In |FRAME: TAX-1063| and many other 
prokaryotes, no gene encoding protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4) has been definitively identified, 
although the gene has been identified as <i>hemG</i> in |FRAME:TAX-562| and <i>hemY</i> 
in |FRAME: TAX-1423|. Reviewed in |CITS: [12177321]|.    

The ferrochelatase reaction involves incorporation of ferrous iron. In bacteria the mechanisms for acquisition of 
ferrous and ferric iron depend upon which form is available in the environment and its abundance. The source 
of ferrous iron for this reaction in bacteria may involve direct import by divalent metal ion transporters, more 
complex mechanisms involving siderophores, other transport systems, and extracellular reductases |CITS: [12054438]|. Reviewed in |CITS: [12829269]|.

In humans, the eight steps of the pathway are divided between the cytosol and the mitochondria, with the final product heme, being synthesized in the mitochondria. The pathway occurs in many cell types and is regulated in a tissue and cell specific manner. The first reaction of the pathway catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX66-342| or |FRAME: CPLX66-342| is considered the rate-limiting step |CITS: [23471474]|. Defects in any of the enzymes in humans, leads to a group of inherited disorders called porphyrias."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-1415"	"superpathway of heme <i>b</i> biosynthesis from uroporphyrinogen-III"	"PWY0-1415"	"Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins.  It is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles.
It is biosynthesized as protoheme, but different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|, |FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.

This superpathway shows the two routes of synthesis found in the facultative anaerobe |FRAME:TAX-562|. Under aerobic conditions, the transition from |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN| is catalyzed by the oxygen -dependent |FRAME: COPROGENOXI-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.3.3). However, when oxygen is not available, the organism is still able to catalyze this transition, using the readical-SAM enzyme |FRAME: HEMN-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.99.22), which can catalyze the transition without the need for molecular oxygen. This enzyme, which contains an iron-sulfur cluster, is able to break SAM into |FRAME: MET| and a 5'-deoxyadenosineyl radical. This radical can attack |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| and bring about the conversion to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN|.

This enzyme is found in many bacteria, but does not appear to be present in archaea or eukarya (the only reference for the enzyme in a eukaryote is in the organism |FRAME: TAX-5911|, but this finding is based on sequence analysis alone, and has not been verified biochemically).

Important branch points within this pathway lead to biosynthesis of other important compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|), |FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|), heme D biosynthesis, and bacteriochlorophyll (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|)."

The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration that generates both energy and reducing power. In addition, it is also the first step in generating precursors for biosynthesis. The pathway is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|.

The input to the cycle is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, an activated form of |FRAME: ACET| that is generated by the degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. A common source of acetyl-coA is |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, which is generated by |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| and converted to acetyl-CoA by the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY \"pyruvate dehydrogenase complex\"|.

In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of acetyl-CoA into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP.

The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that trasport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes.

The name of the TCA (short for tricarboxylic acid) cycle is derived from the fact that the first step in the pathway is attachment of acetyl-coA to |FRAME: CIT|, an acid with three carboxylate groups. The pathway is also known as the citric acid cycle, and as the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle (or just the Krebs cycle), named after the scientists who described it.

Some organisms possess a truncated version of the TCA cycle, known as the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS \"glyoxylate cycle\"|, that converts |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| to biosynthetic intermediates without the loss of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| |CITS:[6378912][3333001][3332993]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This is a common variation of the pathway that occurs in many bacteria and archaea.
There are a few small differences between this prokaryotic version of the cycle and the version found in most eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PWY-5690|). In this pathway, an NADP-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: ISOCITDEH-RXN \"EC 1.1.1.42\"|) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, while eukaryotes employ an NAD+-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: ISOCITRATE-DEHYDROGENASE-NAD+-RXN \"EC 1.1.1.41\"|). Another difference is that while in most eukaryotes the conversion of |FRAME: MAL| to |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| is catalyzed only by an NAD-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: HS07366-MONOMER \"EC 1.1.1.37\"|), prokaryotes that employ this variation of the TCA cycle possess an alternative quinone-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: RXNI-3 \"EC 1.1.5.4\"|). 

While the pathway is most common in heterotrophic bacteria and arachaea, there is evidence for its presence in some facultatively autotrophic archaea when growing under heterotrophic conditions.

In |FRAME: TAX-562|, when acetate is the carbon source, citrate synthase is rate-limiting for the TCA cycle |CITS: [3889909][3332995]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

In obligate autotrophs exogenously furnished organic compounds make a very small contribution to cellular carbon |CITS: [4963789]|. In a study conducted with obligate autotrophic |FRAME: TAX-919| strains, as well as several species of |FRAME: TAX-1117|, acetate, which was the most readily incorporated compound of those studied, contributed only about 10% of newly synthesized cellular carbon.

The carbon from pyruvate, acetate, and glutamate provided exogenously was incorporated into restricted groups of cellular amino acids. In addition, the enzymes |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.M9| or |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.71| are missing from the obligate autotrophs that were studied, and activities of malic enzyme and succinate dehydrogenase had extremely low levels.

The authors concluded that the tricarboxylic acid cycle in these organisms is blocked at the level of |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| oxidation |CITS: [4963789]|. A later study showed that while most cyanobacteria do posses the enzymes required for a full TCA cycle (see |FRAME: P105-PWY|), cyanobacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-1218| and marine |FRAME: TAX-1129| genera lack |FRAME: G185E-5419-MONOMER \"2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase\"| and thus are likely to operate the pathway described here |CITS: [Zhang11]|."

The name of the TCA (short for tricarboxylic acid) cycle is derived from the fact that the first step in the pathway is attachment of acetyl-coA to |FRAME: CIT|, an acid with three carboxylate groups. The pathway is also known as the citric acid cycle, and as the Szent-Gyorgyi-Krebs cycle (or just the Krebs cycle), named after the scientists who described it.

Some organisms possess a truncated version of the TCA cycle, known as the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS \"glyoxylate cycle\"|, that converts |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| to biosynthetic intermediates without the loss of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| |CITS:[6378912][3333001][3332993]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The enzyme |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-RXN \"2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase\"|, a key member of the \"standard\" TCA cycle that converts |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| to |FRAME: SUC-COA|, is absent, or not expressed, in many organisms, including obligately autotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea |CITS: [15449607]|, as well as mycobacteria |CITS: [16045627]|. Most cyanobacteria also lack a gene encoding the enzyme |CITS: [4963789][15449607][21282404]|.

The absence of this enzyme could in theory result in incomplete oxidative or reductive TCA cycles that supply biosynthetic intermediates in response to growth conditions (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P42-PWY|). However, in some cases other enzymes substitute for the missing activity and complete the cycle. For example, some archaea and the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-210| possess the enzyme |FRAME: 2-OXOGLUTARATE-SYNTHASE-RXN \"2-oxoglutarate synthase\"| (see |FRAME: REDCITCYC|) |CITS: [10091606]|.  

In the pathway described here, the role of 2-oxoglutarate dehydorgenase is replaced by |FRAME: CPLX-8408| |CITS: [Zhang11]|. Succinate can also be formed by a reductive TCA half-cycle, or by the glyoxylate bypass found in this organism, as shown here (in |CITS: [16027371]|) (see |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|).  

The pathway is believed to operate in several types of mycobacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1772| and |FRAME: TAX-1765| |CITS: [16027371][19936047][21561773]|.

The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration that generates both energy and reducing power. In addition, it is also the first step in generating precursors for biosynthesis. The pathway is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|.

The input to the cycle is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, an activated form of |FRAME: ACET| that is generated by the degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. A common source of acetyl-coA is |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, which is generated by |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| and converted to acetyl-CoA by the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY \"pyruvate dehydrogenase complex\"|.

In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of acetyl-CoA into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP.

The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that trasport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes.

The name of the TCA (short for tricarboxylic acid) cycle is derived from the fact that the first step in the pathway is attachment of acetyl-coA to |FRAME: CIT|, an acid with three carboxylate groups.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

There has been considerable debate over whether |FRAME: TAX-210| has a complete oxidative citric acid cycle as shown here or a branched modified form of a citric acid cycle, similar to that of |FRAME:TAX-562| under anaerobic conditions. Since the original genomic sequence of |FRAME: TAX-210| lacked open reading frames (ORFs) for three of the typical citric acid cycle enzymes, |FRAME: TAX-210| initially was believed to contain a noncyclic branched pathway whereby one branch operates in an oxidative direction converting oxaloacetate to &alpha;-ketoglutarate via citrate and isocitrate, while the other operates in a reductive direction converting oxaloacetate to succinate via malate and fumarate |CITS: [10091606][10477311][10477312]|. 

However, it was later discovered that the organism contains alternative enzymes for the three missing citric acid cycle enzymes, suggesting that it may have a complete citric acid cycle after all.  Biochemical studies demonstrated that |FRAME: TAX-210| has a ferredoxin-dependent |FRAME: EC-1.2.7.3| instead of the NAD+-dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase |CITS: [9495749]| , |FRAME: EC-2.8.3.5| instead of succinyl-CoA synthetase |CITS: [9495749]|, and |FRAME: EC-1.1.5.4| instead of an NAD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase |CITS: [10809701]|.

There is still some debate over whether the fumarate reductase of |FRAME: TAX-210| can operate as a succinate dehydrogenase as proposed in this pathway. Although several authors detected succinate dehydrogenase activity in biochemical assays |CITS: [7781988][10809701]|, Pitson et al. detected no such activity |CITS: [10091606]|. The enzyme has been shown to function <i>in vitro</i> using benzyl viologen as the electron donor|CITS: [9434188]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Acetic acid bacteria are Gram-negative acidophilic &alpha;-proteobacteria that oxidize ethanol to acetate. These bacteria are highly resistant to high levels of both of these membrane-permeable compounds. The citric acid cycle of these organisms has been shown to converts acetate to CO<sub>2</sub>.

Studies of the the vinegar producing bacterium |FRAME: TAX-435| have shown that instead of the |FRAME: SUCCCOASYN| enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: SUC-COA| to |FRAME: SUC| in most bacteria, this organism possesses a |FRAME: CPLX-8672|, an enzyme that links acetate metabolism with the TCA cycle |CITS: [18502856]|. The enzyme couples the conversion of |FRAME: SUC-COA| to |FRAME: SUC| to the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, and thus simultaneously reduces the acetate concentration and reduces the metabolic demand for free |FRAME: CO-A|. The enzyme is essential for survival in high acetate concentrations |CITS: [2156811]|.

Another enzyme of the TCA cycle, |FRAME: CPLX-8671|, has also been found to be essential for acetate resistance |CITS: [2156811]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-RXN \"2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex\"|, a key member of the \"standard\" TCA cycle that converts |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| to |FRAME: SUC-COA|, is absent, or not expressed, in many organisms, including obligately autotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea |CITS: [15449607]| as well as mycobacteria |CITS: [16045627]|. Most cyanobacteria also lack a gene encoding the enzyme |CITS: [4963789][15449607][21282404]|.

The absence of this enzyme could theoretically result in incomplete oxidative or reductive TCA cycles that supply biosynthetic intermediates in response to growth conditions (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P42-PWY|). However, in some cases other enzymes substitute for the missing activity and complete the cycle. For example, some archaea and the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-210| possess the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.2.7.3| (see |FRAME: REDCITCYC|) |CITS: [10091606]|.  

In the pathway described here, the role of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is replaced by two enzymes, |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.71|| and |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.79 \"EC 1.2.1.79, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase\"| | |CITS: [Zhang11]|. Similarly to the glyoxylate shunt, this pathway bypasses the synthesis of ATP via succinate thiokinase. Note that by avoiding the generation of ATP, this variant of the TCA cycle is not inhibited by high ATP concentration, which is typical in photosynthetic organisms.

Since succinyl-CoA  is not produced by the pathway, pools of succinyl-CoA for synthesis of methionine, diaminopimelate, sulfolipids and heme have to be derived in an energy-dependent manner, either from succinate at the expense of ATP (by succinyl-CoA synthetase) or from methylmalonyl-CoA via methylmalonyl-CoA mutase |CITS: [16027371][Munoz-Elias06]|.
Succinate can also be formed by a reductive TCA half-cycle, or by the glyoxylate bypass found in this organism, as shown here (in |CITS: [16027371]|) (see |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|).

The 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase reactions have been shown in |FRAME: TAX-3039| |CITS: [SHIGEOKA86][1910306]|, in some rhizobia |CITS: [10781553]|, and in cyanobacteria |CITS: [Zhang11]|. The pathway was also thought to exist in mycobacteria |CITS: [16027371]|, but it was later shown that the key enzyme  |FRAME: MONOMER-17040| is missing from those organisms |CITS: [20416504]|, and that they operate a different variation instead (see |FRAME: PWY-6969|)."

These compounds form a structurally diverse class of nucleoside analogues that often possess antibiotic, antineoplastic, or antiviral activities.

Various species of Streptomyces produce 7-Deazapurine nucleoside antibiotics, such as |FRAME: CPD-13056|, |FRAME: CPD-13052|, |FRAME: CPD-13054|, and |FRAME: CPD-13055|.

An important |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines 7-deazapurine\"| compound is |FRAME: CPD-13053|, a modified nucleoside that is present in certain tRNAs in bacteria and most eukaryotes (with the exception of mycoplasmas and yeast) but not in the archaea |CITS: [ 12697167]|. The pathway describing the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-13053| can be found at |FRAME: PWY-6700|.

The biosynthesis of all 7-deazapurines proceeds via the common intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, which is produced in four steps from the nucleotide |FRAME:GTP|. The pathway starts with the conversion of GTP to |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3| by |FRAME: FOLE-CPLX|, an enzyme that is also involved in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: THF|. |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3| is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-1699| by the action of |FRAME: G7431-MONOMER| (|FRAME: G7431|). This intermediate is converted to |FRAME: CPD-13043| by an unusual transformation catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU13740-MONOMER| (|FRAME: BSU13740|), a member of the radical SAM enzyme superfamily. 
Finally, the carboxylate moiety of the latter is converted subsequently to a nitrile in an ATP-dependent reaction, in which ammonia serves as the nitrogen source, catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU13720-MONOMER| (|FRAME: BSU13720|), generating  the final product, |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| |CITS: [19354300]|.

The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY \"pentose phosphate pathway\"| is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism. It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|. Regardless of the carbon source upon which
|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses. The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|. 

For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY \"oxidative portion\"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY \"non-oxidative portion\"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|."

deoxyinosine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  All are cleaved by the same <i>deoD</i>-encoded
phosphorylase, yielding the corresponding bases (adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine) and
D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, which is converted to D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that also can utilize
D-ribose-1-phosphate as a substrate.  A specific aldolase splits D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, yielding
D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which enters central metabolism through the glycolytic pathway, and acetaldehyde,
which must be converted to acetyl-CoA before it can enter central metabolism. 

Although |FRAME:TAX-562| is able to utilize the deoxyribose moiety of deoxyribonucleosides, it is unable to utilize
exogenously supplied deoxyribose; however, the closely related organism |FRAME:TAX-90371| can.

The amino nitrogen of adenine and guanine but not the nitrogen atoms in the purine bases can serve as total
sources of nitrogen for |FRAME:TAX-562|.

It is not found in the archaea |CITS: [ 12697167]|. Prokaryotes can synthesize queuosine <i>de novo</i> by a complex biosynthetic pathway, whereas eukaryotes are unable to synthesize it, and utilize a salvage system, acquiring the |FRAME: QUEUINE| base as a nutrient factor from their diet or from intestinal microflora |CITS: [19925456 ]|.

Queuosine and its derivatives occur exclusively at position 34 (the wobble position) in the anticodons of tRNAs coding for the amino acids |FRAME: HIS|, |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE|, |FRAME: ASN| and |FRAME: TYR| |CITS: [ 4550561]|. Each of these tRNAs posses the anticodon sequence GUN (positions 3436), where N can be any nucleotide. Queuosine improves accuracy of translation |CITS: [ 2988936][11532950]|. These tRNAs of the 'Q-family' originally contain guanine in the first position of anticodon, which is post-transcriptionally modified with |FRAME: QUEUINE| by an irreversible insertion during maturation. 

Beside the 7-deazaguanosine core, quenosine possesses an additional adaptation - a cyclopentendiol ring attached to an aminomethyl group at position 7. In in some mammalian species the cyclopentendiol ring is further modified by glycosylation with galactose (on |FRAME: ASP-tRNAs|) or mannose (on |FRAME: TYR-tRNAs|) at the C5'' hydroxyl (see |FRAME: 2.4.1.110-RXN \"EC 2.4.1.110\"|) |CITS: [190593]|. In bacteria |FRAME: ASP-tRNAs| appears to be glutamylated at the same position (see |FRAME: EG11362-MONOMER|) |CITS: [16164993]|.

The first part of the pathway leading to formation of queuosine, up to the intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, is described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6703|. 

|FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE \"PreQ<sub>0</sub>\"| is a common intermediate, and is also found in the pathways leading to the biosynthesis of several 7-deazapurine antibiotics produced by Streptomyces species. Before it can be inserted into a tRNA it is converted into |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.7.1.13| (|FRAME: G7452|). This enzyme uses 2 NADPH molecules to reduce the nitrile group of |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| to an amino group |CITS: [15767583]|. The next enzyme, |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.29| (|FRAME: EG10996|) catalyzes a complex reaction in which |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| is transferred into a target tRNA molecule, replacing the guanine base, and generating a 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine nucleoside at position 34 |CITS: [8323579]|. The enzyme recognizes the anticodon region of its substrate, and only acts on tRNAs that contain a GUN sequence |CITS: [8494901]|.
The third enzyme, |FRAME: EC-2.4.99.17| (|FRAME: EG10812|) transfers a ribose moiety from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| to the tRNA, resulting in the formation of the 2,3-epoxy-4,5-dihydroxycyclopentane ring of epoxyqueuosine and releasing |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: MET| |CITS: [8347586][7849103]|. In the last step of the pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.17.99.6|, the eopxy bonds are reduced, generating the final queuosine residue. Two different enzymes, not related to each other, have been found to catalyze the last step, encoded by the |FRAME: G7843| and |FRAME: HP0100| genes, respectively. Some organisms possess both genes, but most contain only one form |CITS: [21502530][28128549]|."

The nucleotides |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and |FRAME: GDP-TP| (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism |CITS: [18039766] [18430135]|.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.

Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new <i>in vitro</i> synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP|.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied |FRAME:TAX-562| many details of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.

In the |FRAME:TAX-562| stringent response transcription, translation and DNA replication are affected by (p)ppGpp levels.  Transcription is redirected from genes related to growth to genes involved in survival under starvation and stress conditions.  The regulation of transcription by (p)ppGpp occurs at the transcription initiation stage and affects promoter use.  However, the mechanism remains unclear and direct and indirect models for regulation have been proposed.  It has been shown that |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| and a cofactor protein DksA bind to RNA polymerase and modulate its activity at promoters |CITS: [15294157] [15899978]|, although the exact |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| binding site(s) responsible for regulation are undefined |CITS: [18272182]|.  Transcription of many &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent genes and genes dependent upon alternative sigma factors is negatively or positively regulated by |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP|.  In direct models for regulation, |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| affects the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction via stabilization, or destabilization of the RNA polymerase-promoter open complex.  Indirect models include changes in the availability of RNA polymerase, and a role for |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| in regulating differential binding of sigma factors to core RNA polymerase.  Transcriptional alterations resulting from these mechanisms include repression of tRNA and rRNA synthesis (a key event in limiting the growth rate), induction of stress response factors, and induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport.  Reviewed in |CITS: [16554711] [15686546] [18359660]|.

In |FRAME:TAX-562| the regulation of translation by (p)ppGpp involves its repression of transcription of rRNA, tRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as its interaction with initiation factor IF2 and possibly with elongation factors.  The regulation of DNA replication by (p)ppGpp in |FRAME:TAX-562| involves inhibition of the initiation step.  The demonstration that the |FRAME:TAX-562| DnaG primase is inhibited by |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| <i>in vitro</i> also suggests inhibition of the elongation step |CITS: [19945481]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18359660]|.

In |FRAME:TAX-562| the products of genes <i>relA</i> and <i>spoT</i> have prominent roles in (p)ppGpp metabolism.  This was shown by the absence of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| in <i>relA</i>/<i>spoT</i> null mutants under stringent conditions |CITS: [2005134]|.  RelA functions as a synthetase and SpoT mainly as a hydrolase, although it also has synthetase activity.  Regulation of these opposing activities is critical for the ability of bacteria to respond to nutritional stress and to avoid a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp..  Homologous variants of the RelA and SpoT genes encoding Rsh proteins (Rel Spo homologs) are found in some bacteria and plants.  The &beta;- and &gamma;-proteobacteria have proteins homologous to RelA and SpoT, while most other bacteria have a bifunctional protein designated Rel.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629]|.

Experiments have shown that regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by RelA in response to amino acid starvation occurs at the level of translation on the ribosome.  Ribosome-associated RelA produces |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| in response to the presence of uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site which results in a stalled ribosome.  Regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by SpoT is less well understood, but involves sensing other sources of nutrient stress, such as a limitation in fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [17078815]|.  SpoT also senses phosphate starvation |CITS: [17640895]| and iron limitation |CITS: [15853883]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [16554711]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway shown here for the biosynthesis and metabolism of (p)ppGpp is based upon that shown in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see reference below) except as noted.  Early kinetic studies established the overall pathway of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| metabolism.  The first product of the stringent response to amino acid starvation is |FRAME: GDP-TP| which is quickly converted to the more stable compound |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP|.  |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| is then hydrolyzed to |FRAME: GDP| |CITS: [782536] [321933]|.  A role for a kinase in converting |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN| back to |FRAME: GTP| to complete a cycle was proposed early (in |CITS: [321933] [365225]|) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the product of gene <i>ndk</i>, was suggested as a likely candidate.  This was supported by mutant studies in |FRAME:TAX-28901| serovar Typhimurium (|FRAME:TAX-90371|) although there is no direct evidence for a unique effect of Ndk on (p)ppGpp levels in |FRAME:TAX-562| or <i>S. typhimurium</i> (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).

RelA can catalyze the conversion of both |FRAME: GTP| to |FRAME: GDP-TP|, and |FRAME: GDP| to |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| with similar <i>S</i><sub>0.5</sub> values derived from the Hill equation.  These values are well below the intracellular pool concentrations of |FRAME: GTP| and |FRAME: ATP|, but are similar to the intracellular pool concentration of |FRAME: GDP| |CITS: [3015258]|.  Therefore |FRAME: GDP-TP| is probably the main RelA product, although both reactions are shown here (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  In addition to a synthetase (PSI) domain, RelA also contains an inactive hydrolase domain (in |CITS: [18454629]|).  RelA is responsible for ppGpp synthesis during the stringent response to amino acid starvation.

<i>In vivo</i> |FRAME: GDP-TP| is rapidly converted to |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| by Gpp (reviewed in |CITS: [15590778]|).  It is the major route of |FRAME: GDP-TP| degradation, although minor routes via enzymes with similar activity may also exist (Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).

SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both a hydrolase activity and a weak synthetase activity (designated PSII) |CITS: [2005135] [8730877]|.  The SpoT |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| hydrolase activity is inhibited under conditions of physiological stress and has a major role in |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| degradation.  The role of the SpoT synthetase (PSII) activity is less clear.  It has been proposed to have a role in maintaining the basal level of |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| during exponential growth (in |CITS: [8648647]|).  SpoT also has pppGpp hydrolase activity |CITS: [365225]| and possibly pppGpp synthetase activity.  The putative SpoT |FRAME: GDP-TP| synthetase activity is based on mutant phenotype.  In &Delta;<i>relA</i>/&Delta;<i>gpp</i> mutants starved for glucose |FRAME: GDP-TP| accumulates which suggests phosphoryl group transfer to |FRAME: GTP| as well as |FRAME: GDP|, although the phsophoryl donor is not known (cited as unpublished data in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  This reaction is not shown here.

Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the major pathways of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA \"TCA cycle\"|. Glycolysis is essential under all conditions of growth, because it produces six of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules (the six compounds are |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|). Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.

Even though glycolysis is often described starting with glucose, other hexoses (e.g. fructose) can also serve as input (as its name implies - glycose is a general term for simple sugars).

Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:

i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and

ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.

Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX \"fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase\"| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The difference between this pathway and the one described in |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS| is that glucose is phosphorylated not by a PTS transporter but intracellularly by |FRAME:CPLX-4241|. This reaction can be catalyzed by a general |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.1 \"hexokinase\"| (EC 2.7.1.1) |CITS: [ArchMicr161-460] [9075622]|, but some organisms have a highly specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.2 \"glucokinase\"| (EC 2.7.1.2) |CITS: [14553940]|.

In mammals, glycolysis always begins with the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate |CITS: [1637300]|. This ensures that the intracellular glucose concentration is kept low and promotes the continuous transport of glucose into the cell. In mammalian liver this reaction is carried out by glucokinase, an isozyme of hexokinase which has a much lower affinity (high Km) for glucose so it is effective only when glucose is abundant |CITS: [3902008]|. Its role is to provide glucose 6-phosphate for the synthesis of glycogen.

Glucose 6-phosphate is then isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate in a reversible reaction whose direction is driven by the concentration of fructose 6-phosphate |CITS: [12573240]|. A second phosphorylation event converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6 bisphosphate in a rate limiting irreversible step |CITS: [16742819]|. The formation of two charged groups prevents the diffusion of substrates out of the cell. This six-carbon sugar is then cleaved into two three-carbon sugars that are interconvertible |CITS: [999838]|. 

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate enters the second stage of the pathway that results in the production of 4 ATP and 2 NADH molecules with a net gain of 2 ATP and 4 NADH |CITS: [6188151][BERG02]|. The two substrate-level phosphorylation steps that produce ATP are catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase respectively, and are important regulatory points in the glycolytic pathway |CITS: [BERG02]|.

Glycolysis from internal glucose is also found in many prokaryotes. For example, |FRAME: TAX-2336| is a hyperthermophilic anaerobic eubacterium that can utilize various sugars or complex organic substrates as carbon and energy sources. With glucose as a substrate, |FRAME: TAX-2336| produces lactate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen as the main fermentation products (see |FRAME: PWY-5100|).

The organism has a highly specific |FRAME:CPLX-4241| and a periplasmic, high-affinity glucose-binding protein, suggesting the use of an ATP-binding casette (ABC) transporter for glucose entry into the cell |CITS: [12427944]|. The rest of the pathway occurs via the conventional Embden-Meyerhof pathway |CITS: [ArchMicr161-460][8791626][9075622][2318202]|."

Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the major pathways of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA \"TCA cycle\"|. Glycolysis is essential under all conditions of growth, because it produces six of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules (the six compounds are |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|). Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.

Even though glycolysis is often described starting with glucose, other hexoses (e.g. fructose) can also serve as input (as its name implies - glycose is a general term for simple sugars).

Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:

i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and

ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.

Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX \"fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase\"| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The standard glycolysis pathway (|FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS|) depicts the sugar input into the pathway as glucose. However, the glycolysis pathway is utilized for the degradation of many different types of sugars.

This partial depiction of the glycolysis pathway is used with substrates other than glucose, such as |FRAME: ALLOSE|,
|FRAME: CPD-9569| , |FRAME: MANNITOL| , |FRAME: SORBITOL| , |FRAME: MANNOSE| and |FRAME: SUCROSE|,
which are processed into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P|.
D-fructose 6-phosphate enters glycolysis and is processed to the end product pyruvate, which is often fermented
further into fermentation products such as |FRAME: ETOH|, |FRAME: Lactate| and |FRAME: ACET|."

In many bacteria |FRAME: Glycogens \"glycogen\"| is the primary carbon and energy storage compound. Evidence suggests that it may play a role in the long-term survival of the cell.

In |FRAME: TAX-562| glycogen is stored in granules in the cytosol |CITS: [16816199]|. It is biosynthesized in a highly regulated manner when carbon is plentiful but other nutrients are limiting (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|). The glycogen is broken down and utilized when carbon sources become limiting |CITS: [21421758][22750467]|.

|FRAME: Glycogens \"Glycogen\"|, |FRAME: Starch|, or |FRAME: Pullulans| are too large to be imported into the cell, and bacteria that do not have extracellualr enzymes that can break it outside the cell are not able to grow on exogenous polymers, although they are able to grow on smaller linear &alpha;-1,4-linked |FRAME: Maltodextrins \"maltodextrins\"| ranging in size from maltose up to about 20 glucose units in length (in Mayer and Boos |CITS: [ecosal]|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

During endogenous glycogen degradation, |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.1| (encoded by |FRAME: EG10380|) progressively releases |FRAME: GLC-1-P| from the non-reducing ends of linear &alpha;-(1,4)-glycan chains, but is not able to break bonds that are close to &alpha;(1,6)-branch linkages, leaving tails of 4 &alpha;-1,4-linked residues next to branching points. The highly-branched, short-chained product formed by exhaustive hydrolysis by |FRAME: GLYCOPHOSPHORYL-CPLX| has been named |FRAME: CPD0-971|, since it is the limit of what this enzyme is able to achieve on its own.

This pathway is defined by the next enzyme, a type of debranching enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: EG10381| gene, which is unique to bacteria. This enzyme can remove &alpha;-1,6-linked branches that are up to four glucosyl residues in length, to produce a debranched limit dextrin (also called a debranched glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin) and shorter |FRAME: MALTOTETRAOSE| molecules |CITS: [15687211][16816199]|. Note that this enzyme is different from the debranching system composed of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.25| and |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.33|, which releases monosaccharides (see |FRAME: PWY-5941|).

Maltodextrin phosphorylase, encoded by |FRAME: EG10560|, phosphorylytically cleaves glucosyl residues from the nonreducing end of the resulting maltodextrins producing &alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate and a shortened maltodextrin. Maltotetraose is the smallest acceptable substrate, and thus the ultimate product of MalP is maltotriose, an endogenous inducer of the maltose system (see below) |CITS: [16816199][16321936]|.

Further breakdown of the maltodextrin intermediates, |FRAME: MALTOTRIOSE| and |FRAME: MALTOSE|, involves the products of the maltose utilization genes |FRAME: EG10565| and |FRAME: EG10561|. In |FRAME: TAX-562| the expression of these genes, as well as |FRAME: EG10560|, is activated by |FRAME: MALTOTRIOSE| |CITS: [16321936][16816199][19028900]|.

Maltodextrin glucosidase, encoded by |FRAME: EG10565|, can cleave an &alpha;-D-glucose residue from maltotriose, producing maltose |CITS: [16816199][19028900]|.

Amylomaltase, encoded by |FRAME: EG10561|, is a 4-&alpha;-glucanotransferase that is essential for maltose degradation in |FRAME: TAX-562|. Amylomaltase preferentially removes glucose from the reducing ends of maltose and small maltodextrins, transferring the enzyme-bound dextrinyl residue to the nonreducing ends of other maltodextrins, thereby forming longer maltodextrins (in |CITS: [21421758]|). In this process the number of glucosidic linkages remains constant. Therefore MalQ can both degrade and synthesize the inducer maltotriose, allowing induction when the bacteria are grown on maltodextrins |CITS: [16816199]|. 

The two products of this degradation pathway are |FRAME: Glucopyranose| and |FRAME: GLC-1-P|. Both products are converted to |FRAME: D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate|, whose &beta;-epimer enters |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis|."

Examples were found in a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genera including Gram-negative

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6471"	"peptidoglycan biosynthesis IV (Enterococcus faecium)"	"PWY-6471"	"<b>General Background</b>

The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmospheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria.
This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as \"basal structure\", \"mucopeptide\", \"glycopeptide\", \"glycosaminopeptide\" and \"murein\"). Peptidoglycan is found on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane of almost all eubacteria, and is unique to these organisms.

Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.
The glycan moiety of the peptidoglycan is remarkably uniform among all bacteria, and is made up of alternating &beta;-1,4-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and <i>N</i>-acetyl muramate residues, with an average chain length (in different organisms) of 10 to 65 disaccharide units (although it is about 5000 in |FRAME: TAX-1423|). The peptide moiety is less uniform, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5265|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway describes the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan found in Gram-positive Enterococci , including |FRAME: TAX-1352| and |FRAME: TAX-1354|. The peptidoglycan of these organisms is characterized by having |FRAME:LYS| at position 3 of the pentapeptide, and by including a |FRAME: CPD-302| or |FRAME: CPD-3633| bridge in the crosslinks between glycan strands.

Six cytoplasmic steps catalyze the formation of the |FRAME:UDP-NAcMur-Peptides| precursor. This precursor is attached to the memberane acceptor |FRAME:UNDECAPRENYL-P|, generating |FRAME:NAcMur-Peptide-Undecaprenols|, also known as lipid I.
Another transferase adds |FRAME:UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, yielding lipid II, which carries the full monomer unit, |FRAME:NAcMur-Peptide-NAcGlc-Undecaprenols |.

The next step of the pathway describes the amidation of the |FRAME: D-GLT| at the second position of the pentapeptide. 
In most of the organisms which have been examined, including |FRAME: TAX-1352|, the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is present as an amide; i.e. the second amino acid in the peptide sequence is |FRAME: CPD-12296| |CITS: [5219821][6025572][5968582]|. Some characterization of the reaction has been carried out, although the identity of the enzyme that catalyzes it in |FRAME: TAX-1352| is still unknown |CITS: [5638594]|.
Following amidation, the final lipid intermediate is transferred by an as yet unknown mechanism through the membrane.

The peptidoglycan monomers are polymerized on the outside surface by glycosyltransferases, which form the linear glycan chains, and transpeptidases, which catalyze the formation of peptide crosslinks |CITS: [11320055]|. While some of these enzymes are mono-functional, the main enzymes are bifunctional proteins possessing both glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activities |CITS: [9791115]|.

Peptide cross-links form between different parts of the peptides depending on the organism. In |FRAME: TAX-1352| the crosslinks includes an interpeptide bridge of a single |FRAME: CPD-302| or |FRAME: CPD-3633| residue (see |FRAME: PWY-6461|). |FRAME: CPD-302| is added to lipid II by a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: MONOMER-15487| (encoded by the |FRAME: G-11868| gene) |CITS: [16510449]| and is subsequently amidated to |FRAME: CPD-3633| by the |FRAME: G-11898|-encoded |FRAME: MONOMER-15525|. The crosslinks are formed between the carboxyl group of the penultimate |FRAME: D-ALANINE| (residue 4) of one peptide and the amino group of the |FRAME: CPD-3633| of a peptide in a second glycan chain.

The crosslinking reaction is catalyzed by D-D transpeptidases, a group of enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins \"penicillin-binding proteins\"| (PBPs), and involves the cleavage of the D-alanyl-D-alanine bond of the pentapeptides, which provides the energy to drive the reaction. As a result, the peptides in the peptidoglycan polymers are one amino acid shorter than the peptides in the monomers. These crosslinking enzymes are the target of &beta;-lactam antibiotics.

<b>Penicillin Resistance</b>

Some Enterococci, including |FRAME: TAX-1352|, are intrinsically resistant to moderate levels of |FRAME: CPD-9195|, with MICs typically ranging from 1 to 16 &mu;g/ml.
Studies performed with |FRAME: TAX-1354| showed that one such enzyme in particular, |FRAME: MONOMER-15537|, is responsible for the resistance in this strain. This enzyme, which has a a low-affinity towards penicillin, can substitute the functions of the other PBPs which become inactive in the presence of the antibiotic.

While the |FRAME: G-11910| gene is located on a plasmid in |FRAME: TAX-1354|, it is chromosomally located in |FRAME: TAX-1352|, and is considered to be intrinsic to the species, although it can be treansferred among strains by chromosome-to-chromosome transfer |CITS: [16304165]|.

Recently, an increase in ampicillin resistance has been observed in clinical |FRAME: TAX-1352| isolates. 
Studies showed that increased resistance results from two mechanisms - over-production of |FRAME: MONOMER-15537| (expression of the enzyme is controlled by a regulator that is encoded upstream by the <i>psr</i> gene), and mutation of the enzyme to become less sensitive to the antibiotics |CITS: [7811006][9158761][8759860]|.

A 2001 study reported that |FRAME: G-11910| is responsible for intrinsic resistance only to moderate levels of ampicillin, and by itself cannot confer high-level resistance |CITS: [11502534]|. However, this conclusion has been disputed |CITS: [18676222]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6470"	"peptidoglycan biosynthesis V (&beta;-lactam resistance)"	"PWY-6470"	"For description of the regular peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway in Gram-positive bacteria, please see |FRAME: PWY-5265|.

Two main classes of drugs that are used to treat severe infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, the &beta;-lactams and the glycopeptides antibiotics, are targeting this pathway. The mechanism of glycopeptides activity and resistance are described in the pathways of |FRAME: Vancomycin-Resistnace|.

The &beta;-lactams are the first and still the most frequently used class of antibacterial agents. The structure of these compounds contain a D,D linkage that is very similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala bond in the peptidoglycan pentapeptide. The D,D-transpeptidase catalytic domains of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are responsible for cross-linking the peptidoglycan threads (see |FRAME: MONOMER-15471| for an example) recognize this strucutre and bind the &beta;-lactam antibiotics in an irreversible manner, resulting in inactivation of the enzymes.

&beta;-Lactam resistance in pathogenic bacteria is due to production of low-affinity PBPs (for example, methicillin resistance in |FRAME: TAX-1280| caused by the |FRAME: MONOMER-15469| protein, and ampicillin resistance in enterococci which results from the |FRAME: MONOMER-15537| protein), drug detoxification by production of &beta;-lactamases, and decreased permeability. Recently a new mechanism for resistance has been described.
In some strains, such as the case of |FRAME: TAX-1352| D344M512, resistance is a result of a complete bypass of the D,D transpeptidases by an |FRAME: MONOMER-15534 \"L,D transpeptidase\"| |CITS: [10748168]|.

The regular cross-links in Enterococci are formed between the |FRAME: D-ALANINE| residue at position 4 of one peptide and the |FRAME: CPD-302| or |FRAME: CPD-3633| which are attached to the |FRAME:LYS| at position 3 of a second peptide (see |FRAME: PWY-6461|). The D,D-transpeptidase that catalyzes this linkage requires an intact D-Ala-D-Ala bond in the first peptide. This bond is hydrolyzed, providing the energy to drive the reaction.

It has been shown that in the resistant strain a VanY-type |FRAME: CPLX-8039 \"carboxypeptidase\"| is constitutively active |CITS: [20025663]|. This carboxypeptidase, which is resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin, removes the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| residue from all pentapeptides, resulting in peptidoglycan precursors that exclusively include a tetrapeptide. These precursors are not a substrate for the D,D-transpeptidases, but form an excellent substrate for the |FRAME: MONOMER-15534 \"L,D-transpeptidase\"|, encoded by the |FRAME: G-11907| gene, which catalyzes the formation of cross-links between |FRAME: LYS| of the first peptide and the |FRAME: CPD-302| or |FRAME: CPD-3633| residue of the second peptide |CITS:[16144833][16647082]|.

The L,D-transpeptidase is present &beta;-lactam-sensitive strains of |FRAME: TAX-1352|, but is usually inactive due to lack of its substrate - the tetrapeptide form of the peptidoglycan precursor, |FRAME: CPD-12258|. A mutated two-component regulatory system (DdcRS) in the resistant strains is responsible for the activation of the |FRAME: CPLX-8039|, which prepares the substrates for the transpeptidase |CITS: [20025663]|.

By \"by-passing\" the D,D-transpeptidases the enzyme confers resistance towards most &beta;-lactam antibiotics on the organism |CITS: [10748168]|. The enzyme was thought to be completely insensitive to &beta;-lactam antibiotics, but recently it has been shown that it is very sensitive to |FRAME: CPD-9231|, a &beta;-lactam of the carbapenem class |CITS: [17646161]|. The discovery indicated that the spectrum of activity of &beta;-lactams is not restricted to transpeptidases of the DD-specificity, as previously thought."

Serine biosynthesis is a major metabolic pathway in many organisms. |FRAME: SER| is not only used in protein synthesis, but also as a precursor for the biosynthesis of glycine, cysteine, tryptophan, and phospholipids. In the pathway shown here, which operates in bacteria, yeast, and animals, serine is derived from |FRAME: G3P|, an intermediate of glycolysis. 

|FRAME: EC-2.1.2.1|, converts serine to glycine, transferring a methyl group to |FRAME: THF-GLU-N tetrahydrofolate|, thus forming |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF-GLU-N 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate|, the major source of one-carbon units in many organisms, making serine hydroxymethyltransferase a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of many compounds that require a one-carbon unit, such as purines, thymidine, methionine, choline and lipids.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P4-PWY"	"superpathway of L-lysine, L-threonine and L-methionine biosynthesis I"	"P4-PWY"	"This superpathway integrates the biosynthesis of the amino acids |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, |FRAME: LYS|, |FRAME: THR|, and |FRAME: MET|, all of which are derived from the central metabolite |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, an intermediate of the |FRAME:TCA \"TCA cycle\"|. The specific pathways shown here are those used by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562|.

The pathway starts by the reversible transamination of |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID| to |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.1|, providing a link between carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID Oxaloacetate|, which is consumed in this pathway, is replenished from the |FRAME:TCA \"TCA cycle\"|, by |FRAME: EC-6.4.1.1|, and in some bacteria also by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.31| |CITS: [Gottschalk1986]|.

|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is converted in two steps to |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE|, which is the first branch point in this pathway. One branch leads toward |FRAME: LYS| biosynthesis, while the other continues towards the biosynthesis of the other amino acids included in this superpathway |CITS: [14929228]|. Because this step is common to all of the subsequent biosynthetic pathways, |FRAME: TAX-562| has three different enzymes that catalyze it (|FRAME: ASPKINIHOMOSERDEHYDROGI-CPLX \"aspartate kinase I\"|, |FRAME: ASPKINIIHOMOSERDEHYDROGII-CPLX \"aspartate kinase II\"|, and |FRAME: ASPKINIII-CPLX \"aspartate kinase III\"|), which are controlled by the available supply of |FRAME: THR|, |FRAME: MET| and |FRAME: LYS|, respectively |CITS: [4148765]|.
The L-lysine pathway shown here belongs to the diaminopimelate (DAP) group of Lysine pathways, and is known as the succinylase variant (see |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|, as it involves succinylated intermediates.

The rest of the |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE| is converted to |FRAME: HOMO-SER| by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.3|. Once again, |FRAME: TAX-562| has two different enzymes catalyzing this reaction, which are controlled by the availability of |FRAME: THR| and |FRAME: MET|, respectively |CITS: [4551091][4889171]|.
|FRAME: HOMO-SER| can be isomerized to |FRAME: THR| in two steps that involved phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation |CITS: [11368768]|, or alternatively can lead to the formation of |FRAME: MET| in a 4-step pathway. 

For |FRAME: MET| biosynthesis, homoserine is first activated by <i>O</i>-succinylation, and the product is combined with |FRAME: CYS| to form cystathionine. This compound is cleaved to homocysteine, which is subsequently methylated to produce methionine. The last reaction is catalyzed in |FRAME: TAX-562| by two different enzymes, |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| and |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.14|. Both enzymes use |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| as the methyl donor. However, the former requires cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>), while the latter does not |CITS: [1339288]|."

Polyamines are found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and are necessary for normal cellular physiology.  They include the diamine |FRAME: PUTRESCINE|, the triamines |FRAME: SPERMIDINE|, |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| (<i>sym</i>-norspermidine) and |FRAME: CPD-1821| (homospermidine) and the tetraamine |FRAME: SPERMINE| (in |CITS: [20194510]| and in |CITS: [19196710]|).  Links to their biosynthetic pathways can be found by clicking on these compounds links.  See also |FRAME: POLYAMSYN-PWY|, |FRAME: POLYAMINSYN3-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-6565|.  In members of the genus |FRAME:TAX-662|, |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| is a major polyamine (in |CITS: [19196710]|.

In this pathway |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE| donates a carboxyaminopropyl group to |FRAME: CPD-313| to form |FRAME: CPD-9995| in a reaction catalyzed by carboxynorspermidine/carboxyspermidine dehydrogenase (CANSDH).  Decarboxylation of |FRAME: CPD-9995| catalyzed by carboxynorspermidine/carboxyspermidine decarboxylase (CANSDC) produces |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE|.  |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE| is also a precursor for |FRAME: CPD-313| biosynthesis from |FRAME: CPD-470| which is catalyzed by a bifunctional fusion protein L-2,4-diaminobutyrate aminotransferase/decarboxylase (DABA AT/DC) (|CITS: [3697846] [19196710]|  and in |CITS: [20194510]|).

This |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE| based pathway has been experimentally demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> in |FRAME: TAX-666| including a branch of this pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of |FRAME: SPERMIDINE| as shown in the pathway link.  Both pathways are shown together in |FRAME: PWY-6565|.

Heterologous expression in |FRAME:TAX-562| of the genes encoding the enzymes in this pathway resulted in accumulation of |FRAME: CPD-313| and |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| (which are inactive polyamines in |FRAME:TAX-562|).  Deletion of the gene encoding CANSDC in |FRAME: TAX-666| resulted in accumulation of |FRAME: CPD-9995|.  Deletion of the genes encoding either CANSDC or CANSDH led to loss of |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| and |FRAME: SPERMIDINE|, thus identifying the gene encoding CANSDH.  Interestingly,  deletion of the |FRAME: TAX-666| genes encoding either CANSDH or CANSDC reduced the growth rate of planktonic cells by approximately 50% and severely reduced biofilm formation.  Biofilm formation could be rescued by adding exogenous |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE|, but not |FRAME: SPERMIDINE| .  The pathway did not appear to be related to the infectivity of |FRAME: TAX-666|, using a mouse model |CITS: [19196710]|.  Earlier work also suggested a role for |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| in biofilm formation in |FRAME: TAX-666| |CITS: [16237027]|.

Bioinformatic analysis suggested that DABA AT/DC fusion proteins and their clustering with CANSDH and CANSDC were found only in the family |FRAME: TAX-641|, giving support to their role in both |FRAME: SPERMIDINE| and |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| biosynthesis in these organisms.    However, a clustered pair of CANSDH and CANSDC genes was widespread in the &alpha;-, &beta;-, &gamma;-, &delta;- and &epsilon;-proteobacteria, firmicutes and a candidate division TG-1, suggesting that the pathway for |FRAME: SPERMIDINE| biosynthesis may be more widely used.  However, this conclusion could not be extended to |FRAME: NORSPERMIDINE| biosynthesis without experimental support due to the use of |FRAME: CPD-470| in other pathways (see |FRAME: P101-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-6409| and |FRAME: PWY-761|) |CITS: [19196710]|.

The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.

Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway of guanosine nucleotides degradation begins with the conversion of GMP to |FRAME: GUANOSINE|, which is then converted to the free base |FRAME: GUANINE| by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6181| (EC 2.4.2.1). |FRAME: GUANINE \"Guanine\"| is converted to |FRAME:URATE| via |FRAME: XANTHINE| by the enzymes |FRAME: MONOMER-11785| and |FRAME: XANTHINE-OXIDASE| |CITS: [14726515]|.

This pathway is very similar to a pathway that occurs in plants and fungi (|FRAME: PWY-6606|). However, in this pathway  |FRAME: GUANOSINE| is converted to |FRAME: GUANINE| by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6181| (EC 2.4.2.1) while in plants this conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-15864| (EC 3.5.4.15) |CITS: [14725335]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway shares several steps with the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6609|. However, the salvage pathway starts with the free base |FRAME: ADENINE| (which is often transported into the organism) and ends with the nucleotide |FRAME: IMP|, leading to biosynthesis of nucleotides, while this degradation pathway starts with the nucleotide form (|FRAME: AMP|) and ends with |FRAME: URATE|, which in most organisms is degraded further, providing the organism with carbon, nitrogen and energy.

A key enzyme in this pathway is adenosine deaminase, which converts |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: INOSINE|. This has been shown to be the main form of adenosine degradation by the fungi |FRAME: TAX-36642| |CITS: [7551735]| and |FRAME:TAX-293373| |CITS: [15812856]|.

Xanthine degradation to allantoin has been observed in |FRAME:TAX-562|, but this degradation does not progress past allantoin or allantoate and this catabolism does not suffice as a source of nitrogen under aerobic growth conditions  |CITS: [10986234]|."

The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 

Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The key enzyme in the salvage of the pyrimidine nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| is (|FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 \"uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.9)\"| (UPRT), which transfers a phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to uracil, generating |FRAME: UMP| in a single step. The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants |CITS: [16660311][216696][2189783][8856065][11773618][14658380]|. This pathway was shown to be the major route for uracil salvage in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.

Mammals lack the enzyme, and thereby are unable to perform the one-step salvage of uracil |CITS: [15685165]| and are limited to recycling pyrimidine nucleosides via uridine kinases (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|).

Some archaea, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that possess the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7932| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 \"EC 3.5.4.1\"|) are also able to salvage exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by converting it to |FRAME: URACIL| (see |FRAME: PWY-7194|).

Once the nucleobases are converted to |FRAME: UMP|, it can be phosphorylated to form the RNA building blocks |FRAME: UTP| and |FRAME: CTP| by the enzymes that participate in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway, as described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7176|."

The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 

Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This superpathway combines multiple routes in which some organisms (including bacteria, yeast and plants) can salvage the pyrimidine ribonucleosides |FRAME: CYTIDINE| and |FRAME: URIDINE| and convert them to the ribonucleotide |FRAME: UMP|, which can serve as a precursor for the synthesis of all other pyrimidine nucleotides.

Since most of the salvage enzymes have higher activity with |FRAME: URIDINE|, most of the available |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is coverted to |FRAME: URIDINE| by cytidine deaminase, |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.5|.

|FRAME: URIDINE Uridine| is then converted to UMP in one of two routes. In the first route, this transformation is achieved in a single step by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.48 \"uridine kinase (EC 2.7.1.48)\"|. In most organisms this enzyme is also active with |FRAME: CYTIDINE|, and thus can form |FRAME: CMP| as well (although this has not been shown yet for the plant enzymes).

In the second route, |FRAME: URIDINE| is first hydrolyzed to the nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| by |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3 \"uridine nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.3)\"|, and the nucleobase is phosphoribosylated to UMP by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 \"uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.9)\"|.

Mammals have not been included in this superpathway, since they do not have the enzyme uridine nucleosidase and thus can not convert uridine to uracil. They do utilize a nucleoside kinase-based pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7183|)."

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 \"ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase\"|.

The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.

The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 \"thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21)\"|, (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 \"deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74)\"|.
This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria |CITS: [402352]|, mammals |CITS: [7494863]|, and plants |CITS: [22897443]|.

Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans |FRAME: CPLX-8618| is encoded by the |FRAME: HS08100| gene, while two isozymes, encoded by |FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, catalyze thymidine kinase activity |CITS: [6281270][8380161]|.
|FRAME: TAX-3702| posseses two thymidine kinase genes (|FRAME: AT3G07800| and |FRAME: AT5G23070|), and a broad substrate range |FRAME: AT1G72040-MONOMER| encoded by a single |FRAME: AT1G72040| gene that can phosphorylate both |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| |CITS: [22897443]|.
Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-90370|, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine |CITS: [EcoSal]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.

In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE|, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to |FRAME: TMP| by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 \"thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)\"|.

Once formed, the monophosphates are phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis. |FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 \" dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)\"|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 \"bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)\"| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 \"(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)\"|. Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 \"nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)\"|."

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 \"ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase\"|.

The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.

The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 \"thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21)\"| (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 \"deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74)\"|.
This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria |CITS: [402352]|, mammals |CITS: [7494863]|, and plants |CITS: [22897443]|.

Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans |FRAME: CPLX-8618| is encoded by the |FRAME: HS08100| gene, while two isozymes, encoded by |FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, catalyze thymidine kinase activity |CITS: [6281270][8380161]|.

|FRAME: TAX-3702| posseses two thymidine kinase genes (|FRAME: AT3G07800| and |FRAME: AT5G23070|), and a broad substrate range |FRAME: AT1G72040-MONOMER| encoded by a single |FRAME: AT1G72040| gene that can phosphorylate both |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| |CITS: [22897443]|.

Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-90370|, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine |CITS: [EcoSal]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.

In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE|, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to dTMP by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 \"thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)\"|."

Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.  Their diphosphates
form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, for use in biosynthesis.  The
pathway for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is derived from the pathway for
|FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage
pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can
enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and
|FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are
necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when
precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate
and reducing power.  In |FRAME:TAX-562| they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene
expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.

The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic
precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA|
gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine
ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins
with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from
glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to
form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|. 
The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG|
biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from
|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine
nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|
(see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, and |FRAME: PWY0-662|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|,
|FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the
DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are
synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair. 
In |FRAME:TAX-562| this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or
anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived
from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|,
or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.

The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically
and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257|
and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a <i>nrdAB</i> deletion mutant. 
However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes <i>nrdHIEF</i> are overexpressed on a
plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance
ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by
gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812|
and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied
|CITS: [16771665]|.

The major pathway for the aerobic, <i>de novo</i> formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate
precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP|
to |FRAME: DCTP| and deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUTP| which is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: DUMP|. 
This pathway supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.  Most of the remainder is presumed to
be formed from |FRAME: DUDP|, as shown.  In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: EG11418|, |FRAME: EG10219| mutants, an
alternate <i>de novo</i> deoxycytidine pathway to |FRAME: DUMP| is used that relies on salvage enzymes
|CITS: [17827303]|.  Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of
|FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by
|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX|.  Two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is
catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the product
of gene |FRAME: EG10650| which also catalyzes two preceding reactions.

Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.

In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA \"TCA cycle\"|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway shown here illustrates a route in which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to the deoxyribonucleotides |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: DUTP|, which are subsequently modified to other deoxyribonucleotides, including the thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP|. 
While most organisms utilize a different route (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|), this pathway is found in bacteria that possess two specialized enzymes - |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.2 \"ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.2)\"|, an enzyme that can reduce nucleoside triphosphates to their respective deoxynucleoside triphosphates (most organism posses |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 \"EC 1.17.4.1\"|, which can only accept nucleoside diphosphates), and |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 \"dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13)\"|, an enzyme that can deaminate |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUMP|.

In this pathway the deoxyribonucleotide |FRAME: DUTP| is formed in two ways - by the direct reduction of |FRAME: UTP|, and by the deamination of |FRAME: DCTP|, which is formed from |FRAME: CTP| either directly by |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, or in two steps, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7184|.
Once formed, |FRAME: DUTP| is dephosphorylated to |FRAME: DUMP|. Deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| is the major route for <i>de novo</i> formation of |FRAME: DUMP| in aerobically-growing |FRAME:TAX-562|. It supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.

Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| (EC 2.1.1.45).
The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed in this route, , |FRAME: DUTP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.

Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This superpathway illustrates the universal <i>do novo</i> biosynthetic route for producing pyrimidine ribonucleotides (|FRAME: CDP| and |FRAME: UDP|), and the most common route in which these ribonucleotides are converted to the deoxyribonucleotides, including the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP|. This pathway is universal, and is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 \"EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase\"|. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, |FRAME: UMP|, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to |FRAME: UDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DUDP|. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed <i>de novo</i>, |FRAME: CTP|, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to |FRAME: CDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DCDP|.

Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 \"thymidylate synthase\"| (EC 2.1.1.45).
The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, |FRAME: DUDP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form. This is done in two steps - phosphorylation to |FRAME: DUTP|, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.

Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|. The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: HS11626-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: CPLX66-1052|.

In organisms that contain the enzyme |FRAME: DCTP-DEAM-CPLX| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 EC 3.5.4.13\"|), a second route forms |FRAME: DUMP| from |FRAME: DCDP|. |FRAME: DCDP| is phosphorylated to |FRAME: DCTP|, followed by deamination to |FRAME: DUTP| and hydrolysis to |FRAME: DUMP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7187|)."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-7229"	"superpathway of adenosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis I"	"PWY-7229"	"The first purine nucleotide that is synthesized <i>de novo</i> is |FRAME: IMP| (IMP). IMP is converted to |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER|, and the latter is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, |FRAME: AMP| (AMP), by the action of |FRAME:AMPSYN-ENZRXN|.

AMP is phosphorylated to ADP and subsequently to ATP. While the first phosphorylation is catalyzed by the dedicated enzyme |FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|, reactions that convert ADP to ATP are numerous and found in multiple pathways,  including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis. However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: CPLX490-3510 ATP synthase| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes the proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP. This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.

ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form |FRAME: DADP| (dADP) by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate reductase. Once formed, dADP can be phosphorylated into the DNA building block |FRAME: DATP dATP| by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|.

In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the `purR' repressor protein |CITS:[2404765]|."

IMP is converted to |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER|, and the latter is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, |FRAME: AMP| (AMP), by the action of |FRAME:AMPSYN-ENZRXN|.

AMP is phosphorylated to ADP and subsequently to ATP. While the first reaction is catalyzed by the dedicated enzyme
|FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|, reactions that convert ADP to ATP are numerous and found in multiple pathways,  including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis. However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: CPLX490-3510 ATP synthase| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes the proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP. This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.

ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form |FRAME: DADP dADP|. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this conversion is catalyzed by either |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX| or |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTII-CPLX|, which differ by the type of thioredoxin-like enzyme they utilize as the electron donor. dADP is further phosphorylated to the DNA building block |FRAME: DATP dATP| by the broad-substrate range enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|.

A few organisms, including the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562|, also possess the enzyme |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, which can reduce nucleotide triphosphates to their 2'-deoxy forms.

In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the `purR' repressor protein |CITS:[2404765]|."

Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of these nucleotides is critical to normal function.  This occurs through a combination of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis and salvage pathways for pre-existing purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides.

The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary. This fourteen step pathway contains ten steps that branch at |FRAME: IMP| to form |FRAME: AMP| and |FRAME: GMP|, each in two steps. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-1423|</i> and |FRAME:TAX-4932|, but little is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes (metazoa and plants |CITS: [8938402]|). The pathway appears to vary in archaea |CITS: [9150241]|. Some organisms, such as the mycoplasmas, do not biosynthesize purine and pyrimidine bases <i>de novo</i> and must rely on salvage pathways |CITS: [11737647]|.   

In |FRAME: TAX-4932| regulation of the pathway occurs at both the enzyme level as shown in this pathway, and at the genetic level. For example, at the genetic level positive-acting regulatory proteins Bas1 and Pho2 and biosynthetic intermediates |FRAME: P-RIBOSYL-4-SUCCCARB-AMINOIMIDAZOLE| and/or |FRAME: AICAR| are required to derepress <i>ADE</i> gene expression.

IMP is converted to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| (XMP) by the enzyme |FRAME: IMP-DEHYDROG-CPLX|,
and the later is converted to the first guanosine nucleotide, |FRAME: GMP| (GMP), by the action of
|FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX|, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate.
GMP is then converted to |FRAME: GDP| (GDP) and subsequently to |FRAME: GTP| (GTP) by the enzymes
|FRAME: GUANYL-KIN-CPLX| and |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|, respectively.

In |FRAME:TAX-562| both GDP and GTP can be converted to the deoxy forms of the nucleotide. GTP is converted to |FRAME: DGTP|
(dGTP) by the uncommon enzyme |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, while GDP can be converted to |FRAME: DGDP| (dGDP) by either |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX| or |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTII-CPLX|.

Finally, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| can also convert dGDP to dGTP.

In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the `purR' repressor protein |CITS: [2404765]|."

IMP is converted to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE XMP| by the enzyme |FRAME: IMP-DEHYDROG-CPLX|,
and the latter is converted to the first guanosine nucleotide, |FRAME: GMP GMP|, by the action of
|FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX|, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as the nitrogen donor.

GMP is phosphorylated to |FRAME: GDP GDP| and subsequently to |FRAME: GTP GTP| by the enzymes
|FRAME: GUANYL-KIN-CPLX| and |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|, respectively.

GDP can be converted to the deoxy form |FRAME: DGDP dGDP| by the enzyme ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase.
Once formed, dGDP can be phosphorylated to the DNA building block |FRAME: DGTP dGTP| by the enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|.

In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the `purR' repressor protein |CITS: [2404765]|."

Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of these nucleotides is critical to normal function.  This occurs through a combination of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis and salvage pathways for pre-existing purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides.

The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary.  This fourteen step pathway contains ten steps that branch at |FRAME: IMP| to form |FRAME: AMP| and |FRAME: GMP|, each in two steps. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-1423|</i> and |FRAME:TAX-4932|, but little is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes (metazoa, and plants |CITS: [8938402]|). The pathway appears to vary in archaea |CITS: [9150241]|. Some organisms, such as the mycoplasmas, do not biosynthesize purine and pyrimidine bases <i>de novo</i> and must rely on salvage pathways |CITS: [11737647]|.

In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the |FRAME: PC00033| protein. In |FRAME:TAX-562| the 14 reactions involved in the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of AMP and GMP are catalyzed by 12 known genes. These genes occur mostly as unlinked single units or as small functional operons carrying two or, at the most, three structural genes each. The |FRAME: EG10800| gene encodes the repressor controlling the synthesis of all of these enzymes. Sequences similar to the protected region (PUR box) in purF are present in the regulatory regions of purMN. The expression of |FRAME: EG10800| was shown to be autoregulated, probably through blocking of transcription elongation by binding of PurR to the two PUR boxes. So far, six genes/operons have been reported to contain PUR box-like sequences.
The purine biosynthetic pathway is controlled by feedback regulation of activity as well as at the level of transcription
|CITS:[2404765]|.

Reactions that convert ADP to ATP are found in multiple pathways, including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis, and are thus not included in this pathway."

The pathway is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding
the enzymes vary. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes such as |FRAME: TAX-562|,
|FRAME:TAX-1423| and |FRAME:TAX-4932|, but little is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes |CITS: [8938402]|.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6122"	"5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis II"	"PWY-6122"	"|FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE \"5-Amino-1-(5-phospho-&beta;-D-ribosyl)imidazole\"| (AIR) is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of purine nocleotides and |FRAME: THIAMINE|. It is synthesized from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) in 5 steps, which are catalyzed in most organisms by the enzymes
|FRAME: PRPPAMIDOTRANS-CPLX|, |FRAME: GLYCRIBONUCSYN-MONOMER|, |FRAME: GART-MONOMER|,
|FRAME: FGAMSYN-MONOMER| and |FRAME: AIRS-CPLX|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6121|.

In this variant of the pathway, found in |FRAME: TAX-562|, the third step is catalyzed by a different enzyme - |FRAME: GARTRANSFORMYL2-MONOMER|. Unlike |FRAME: GART-MONOMER|, which utilizes |FRAME: 10-FORMYL-THF| as the formyl donor, |FRAME: GARTRANSFORMYL2-MONOMER| utilizes |FRAME: FORMATE|. The two enzymes share little homology.

|FRAME: TAX-562| does have |FRAME: GART-MONOMER| as well, and both enzymes are used, as can be seen in |FRAME: PWY-6277|.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6151"	"<i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle I"	"PWY-6151"	"About 20% of the |FRAME: MET| pool is used as a building block of proteins. The rest is converted to
|FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), the major methyl donor in the cell.
When SAM donates its methyl group, it is converted to |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS|. This molecule can be
recycled back to SAM via the <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle, also known as the activated methyl cycle (AMC).

There are two main variations of this pathway, one found mostly in prokaryotes, while the other is found predominantly, but not exclusively, in eukaryotes. The main difference between the variants is the processing of |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS| (SAH), the immediate product of the methylation reactions.

In the first pathway (described in |FRAME: PWY-6151|) SAH is first hydrolyzed to |FRAME: CPD-564| by the |FRAME: MONOMER-1290|, followed by conversion to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| by |FRAME: CPLX-7753|. 
In the second pathway, which is described in |FRAME: PWY-5041|, SAH is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| in a single step, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-5161|.

The cycle continues with the methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| to |FRAME: MET| using a methyl group from a methylated folate. In some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-9606|, this reaction is catalyzed by a
|FRAME: HOMOCYSMETB12-MONOMER| (EC 2.1.1.13). In other organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|,
the reaction is catalyzed by a |FRAME: G18NG-10711-MONOMER| (EC 2.1.1.14). Yet some organisms,
such as |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-1718|, have both enzymes, as described in the pathway
|FRAME: HSERMETANA-PWY|. In |FRAME: TAX-562| the reaction catalyzed by the B12-dependent enzyme is more
than 100-fold faster than the reaction catalyzed by the B12-independent isoenzyme |CITS: [15215334]|.

Finally, the cycle is completed with the regeneration of SAM by |FRAME: CPLX-7754|."

Sulfur is an essential nutrient for all life forms. Plants, fungi, and many bacteria reduce inorganic sulfate to sulfide to cover their need for the element. Before the sulfur can be assimilated into biosynthetic pathways it needs to be reduced to |FRAME:HS|. Pathways catalyzing the reduction of sulfate to sulfide for the purpose of incorporation into newly synthesized molecules are called pathways of assimilatory sulfate reduction.
In addition, certain organisms can use sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen. Pathways of sulfate reduction for the purpose of energy production are called pathways of dissimilatory sulfate reduction.

The reduction of sulfate to sulfite requires two electrons at a standard redox potential (<i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i>) of -516 mV, which is too high for physiological electron carriers |CITS: [860983]|. The problem is solved by the activation of the sulfate, by forming a mixed anhydride between phosphate and sulfate as in |FRAME:APS| (APS) or |FRAME:PAPS| (PAPS). This linkage lowers the potential to <i>E<sub>0</sub>'</i> = -60 mV, which is easilly covered by thiols or pyrimidine nucleotides |CITS: [14627706]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

In many bacteria and lower eukaryotes, assimilatory sulfate reduction proceeds via activation of |FRAME: SULFATE| to APS by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.4| (also known as ATP sulfurylase). This enzyme has an unfavorable equilibrium (Keq ~ 10<sup>-7</sup> M) in the direction of APS formation, and it has been postulated that the reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of PPi by a ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase |CITS: [2821345]|. In |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was found that the enzymes couples the formation of APS to hydrolysis of GTP |CITS: [8117661]|.

Following sulfate activation, the pathway consists of phosphorylation of APS to PAPS, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.25| (APS kinase), reduction to |FRAME: SO3|, which is catalyzed by the thioredoxin (or glutaredoxin)-dependent |FRAME: EC-1.8.4.8| (PAPS reductase), and a final reduction of sulfite to sulfide, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.8.1.2|."

The biosynthesis of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) can occur via two distinct routes: the |FRAME: PWY-922 \"mevalonate pathway\"| (MVA pathway) and the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY \"methylerythritol phosphate pathway\"| (MEP pathway, this pathway) |CITS: [11078528]|. In the former, IPP is synthesized from the condensation of  three acetyl-CoA molecules; in the MEP pathway IPP is synthesized via the condensation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|.

For many years, the MVA pathway was considered to be the sole source of IPP in all living organisms. However, several inconsistencies led to the discovery of the MEP pathway in bacteria and plants.
In plants the MVA pathway is located in the cytosol whilst the MEP pathway is found in plastids |CITS:[LICHTENTHALER97]|. The MEP pathway is present in most eubacteria, unicellular green algae, the chloroplasts of phototrophic organisms and some unicellular eukaryotes related to photosynthetic phyla, such as the Plasmodium parasites |CITS: [15473867]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

|FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP \"Isopentenyl diphosphate\"| (IPP) and its isomer |FRAME: CPD-4211| (DMAPP) are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are produced from |FRAME: GAP| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE| via this pathway.

D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DOXP). DOXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, |FRAME: 2-C-METHYL-D-ERYTHRITOL-4-PHOSPHATE| (MEP). 
Interestingly, two rather different enzymes, that share no sequence homology, are able to catalyze this reaction - the |FRAME: DXPREDISOM-CPLX \"DXR\"| enzymes, and the |FRAME:MONOMER-15827 \"DRL\"| (DXR-like) enzymes |CITS: [20660776]|.

In the third reaction MEP is converted into |FRAME: 4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C|, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding
|FRAME: 2-PHOSPHO-4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C-MET|. This product is then converted into
|FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. Subsequently, it is reduced to generate |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| |CITS: [12198182]|.

This diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP in the final step. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this ratio is subsequently adjusted to 3:7 by |FRAME: IPPISOM-MONOMER|. IPP and DMAPP serve as the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.  

The difference between this pathway variant and the variant described in |FRAME: PWY-7560| is the conversion of |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| to |FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. In this variant, that enzyme utilizes flavodoxin as the electron donor (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.3|), while in the other variant the enzyme utilizes ferredoxin (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.1|).

This pathway, which is not present in humans, is involved in production of phosphate-containing antigens recognized by &gamma;-&delta; T lymphocytes |CITS: [11675382]|."

Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor. However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the acceptor.

Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be |FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal acceptor, which could be oxygen in the case of aerobic respiration, or another type of molecule in anaerobic respiration. 

Known terminal acceptors include organic compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|), or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|, |FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|, |FRAME: MN+3 \"oxidized manganese ions\"|, |FRAME: FE+3 \"ferric iron\"|, gold, |FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and |FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur \"elemental sulfur\"|).

During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the membrane due to three potential processes:

1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active pumping of protons out of the cell.

2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.

3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.

Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit |FRAME: EC-3.6.3.14 \"ATP synthase\"| enzymes that generate ATP.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are formed in the glycolytic and TCA cycles. Each of these energy-rich molecules has a pair of electrons with high transfer potential. The free energy liberated during transfer of those electrons can be used for synthesizing ATP. This electron transfer is performed by a series of four large electron carriers complexes also known as complex I-IV (electron transport chain or respiratory chain), present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These complexes facilitate the passage of electrons from lower to higher redox potentials. Of those complexes, complex I and II are involved in the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>. The flow of electrons resulting from this oxidation causes protons to be pumped from the matrix side to the intermembrane space. This flow generates a proton-motive force composed of a pH gradient and a membrane potential. Those protons flow back into the matrix through various routes. Particularly, protons flow back through the ATP-synthesizing complex embedded in the mitochondrial membrane leading to the synthesis of ATP. Aerobic respiration parallels the transport of electrons resulting from the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> with the creation of a proton gradient and accompanying membrane potential, leading to the synthesis of ATP |CITS: [DEY97]|.

In contrast to the mitochondrial respiration in mammals and plants (this pathway), the oxidative phosphorylation in |FRAME: TAX-4932| via the respiration chain occurs without complex I. Instead Baker's yeast employs three NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (type II - one internal, two external) which catalyze the reoxidation of cytosolic |FRAME:NADH| to provide |FRAME:NAD| (see |FRAME:PWY-7279|) |CITS:[23086143] [1900238] [9733747] [9696750]|."

found as saprophytes on animals (including humans) and in dairy products (such as Swiss cheese).
Propionibacteria produce large amounts of |FRAME:PROPIONATE| as the end product of glucose
fermentaion.
The first work of importance on the chemistry of propionate fermentation was published as early
as 1878 |CITS:[Fitz78]|.

For a long time propionibacteria were assumed to form propionate by the direct decarboxylation
of |FRAME:SUC-COA| to |FRAME:PROPIONYL-COA| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|
|CITS: [13271286][Wood56]|. A similar mechanism (in the opposite direction) was believed to catalyze
propionate degradation |CITS: [13100070]|.
However, in 1957 it was shown that during propionate catabolism in animal cells the primary
product of |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| carboxylation was not |FRAME:SUC-COA|, but
<b>methylmalonyl-coA</b> |CITS: [13502357]|. That discovery prompted a re-evaluation of the
pathway of propionate fermentation.

A careful analysis revealed that |FRAME:SUC-COA| is not decarboxylated, but is converted to
|FRAME:METHYL-MALONYL-COA|, and that it is the latter compound (after racemization) that is cleaved,
transfering a C1 unit to |FRAME:PYRUVATE| |CITS: [16590594]|.
This reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-7155|, generates |FRAME:PROPIONYL-COA|
and |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|.
The |FRAME:PROPIONYL-COA| that is formed acts as a |FRAME:CO-A|  donor for a different step
of this cycle, where it is transferred to |FRAME:SUC|. This reaction, catalyzed by
|FRAME: MONOMER-13083|, forms |FRAME:SUC-COA| and |FRAME:PROPIONATE|, the final product
of this cycle.

Even though the pathway was investigated mostly in propionibacteria, many other species, including
|FRAME: TAX-894| |CITS: [Stams84]|, |FRAME: TAX-29543| |CITS: [Schink87]| and |FRAME: TAX-865|

Lactic acid fermentation is a process by which sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose are converted into cellular energy and the metabolic byproduct lactate. It occurs in many bacteria and anaerobic lower eukaryotes, as well as in animal cells, such as muscle cells, in the absence of oxygen.
In homolactic fermentation the only product is |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, and thus one molecule of glucose is ultimately converted to two such molecules.

The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram positive bacteria that produce lactate as the major end product of the fermentation of carbohydrates. The LAB were divided early on into two main groups, depending on their fermentation products. One group included those bacteria that convert carbohydrates essentially into lactate, while the other group included those producing, in addition, substantial quantities of volatile acids and carbon dioxide |CITS: [Orla-Jensen19]|.
A few years after this initial classification was established the terms homo- and hetero-fermentative, respectively, were proposed for the two groups |CITS: [Kluyver24]|.
It should be noted that at least some organisms are capable of shifting from one mode of fermentation to the other depending on oxygen or nutrient availability |CITS: [108249]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

In homolactic fermentation sugars are metabolized via the Embden-Myerhof glycolytic pathway to pyruvate, which is then converted to lactate.

Sugars can enter bacterial cells in two different mechanisms. In most homofermentative strains sugars are transported by a sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) that phosphorylates the sugar during transport. |FRAME: GLC| is  phosphorylated to |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, while |FRAME:FRU| is usually phosphorylated to |FRAME:FRU1P| (although some
PTSs were reported to generate |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| |CITS: [8246840][8550437][10627040]|).
The second mechanism involves the transport of sugars via a permease, in which case they are not phophorylated.

All sugars are then activated to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE| through different routes, depending on the nature of the sugar and on the way it enters the cell. Intracellular fructose (that entered by a permease) is phosphorylated first to fructose-6-phosphate, then to fructose-1,6-biphosphate.
Intracellular glucose (that entered by a permease) is first phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate, isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate, and finally phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-biphosphate |CITS: [16741753]|.

Fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1-phosphate (that entered via a PTS) are both phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-biphosphate by |FRAME: CPLX-7324| and |FRAME:MONOMER-13047|, respectively, and  glucose-6-phosphate (that entered via a PTS) is isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate, and finally phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-biphosphate.

The common product, fructose-1,6-biphosphate, is processed via the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway to pyruvate, which is then converted to lactate, the the sole end-product of homolactic fermentation |CITS: [8550437]|. Fructose-1,6-biphosphate is an important regulator of the pathway, being a positive effector of |FRAME:CPLX-7323| |CITS: [Thompson87]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=P125-PWY"	"superpathway of (<i>R,R</i>)-butanediol biosynthesis"	"P125-PWY"	"2,3-butanediol is a compound of commercial interest, mostly as an antifreeze agent due to to its low freezing point |CITS: [Magee87]|. One of its well known applications is the formation of methyl ethyl ketone, by dehydration, which can be used as a liquid fuel additive |CITS: [11234948]|.

Many bacterial species can ferment pyruvate to |FRAME: 2-3-Butanediols \"2-3-butanediol\"| via several intermediate compounds,
including |FRAME: 2-ACETO-LACTATE|, |FRAME: ACETOIN|, and |FRAME: DIACETYL|. Not all species carry the process all the way through - some may stop earlier, accumulating some of the intermediates. 
Of particular importance is the production of |FRAME: DIACETYL|, an important flavor metabolite in dairy products, wine and beer |CITS: [2198252][15454314]|.

The metabolic function of 2,3-butanediol is not well understood, although it may play a role in preventing intracellular
acidification by changing the metabolism from acid production to the formation of a neutral compound
|CITS: [6298028]|.  In addition, the pathway might participate in regulation of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio
in the bacteria |CITS: [8444801]|.

In this pathway |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, which is produced by substrate level phosphorylation, is converted to |FRAME: 2-ACETO-LACTATE| by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-5243| (also known as &alpha;-ALS). 2-acetolactate is an unstable intermediate, and  in the presence of oxygen it can undergo a spontaneous decarboxylation, producing |FRAME: DIACETYL| that is converted to acetoin by the activity of the dual-function enzyme acetoin (diacetyl) reductase (see below).
Under anaerobic conditions  |FRAME: 2-ACETO-LACTATE| is converted directly to acetoin by a decarboxylation step catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-5262| (&alpha;-ALD), and production of diacetyl is bypassed.
The relative activities of &alpha;-ALS and &alpha;-ALD in specific strains determine the fluxes and concentrations of the different intermediates in these organisms.

The two enzyme activities diacetyl reductase and acetoin reductase were initially reported to be catalyzed by two different enzymes |CITS: [13211662]|, and two different EC numbers were issued based on that observation (|FRAME: ACETOINDEHYDROG-RXN \"EC 1.1.1.5\"| and |FRAME: RR-BUTANEDIOL-DEHYDROGENASE-RXN \"EC 1.1.1.4|). However, later research indicated that in most bacteria both activities are catalyzed by the same enzyme, for which the name diacetyl(acetoin) reductase was suggested |CITS: [5540507][4350968][2040298][10647818]|. Moreover, the enzyme appears to have a much wider substrate range than orignally believed, and it has been suggested to rename it L-glycol dehydrogenase |CITS: [2040298]|.

This pathway includes multiple decarboxylation reactions, generating |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.

assembled from several pathways found in a variety of organisms, each producing a different stereoisomer of |FRAME: 2-3-Butanediols \"2-3-butanediol\"|. The purpose of this pathway is to provide an overview of the metabolic capabilities of the ecosystem, pertaining to the biosynthesis of this compound. That said, there are indications that some organisms are indeed capable of producing all three stereoisomers.

2,3-butanediol is a compound of commercial interest, mostly as an antifreeze agent due to to its low freezing point |CITS: [Magee87]|. One of its well known applications is the formation of methyl ethyl ketone, by dehydration, which can be used as a liquid fuel additive |CITS: [11234948]|.

Many bacterial species can ferment pyruvate to |FRAME: 2-3-Butanediols \"2-3-butanediol\"| via several intermediate compounds,
including |FRAME: 2-ACETO-LACTATE|, |FRAME: ACETOIN|, and |FRAME: DIACETYL|. Not all species carry the process all the way through - some may stop earlier, accumulating some of the intermediates. 
Of particular importance is the production of |FRAME: DIACETYL|, an important flavor metabolite in dairy products, wine and beer |CITS: [2198252][15454314]|.

The metabolic function of 2,3-butanediol is not well understood, although it may play a role in preventing intracellular
acidification by changing the metabolism from acid production to the formation of a neutral compound
|CITS: [6298028]|.  In addition, the pathway might participate in regulation of the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio
in the bacteria |CITS: [8444801]|.

In this pathway |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, which is produced by substrate level phosphorylation, is converted to |FRAME: 2-ACETO-LACTATE| by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-5243| (also known as &alpha;-ALS). 2-acetolactate is an unstable intermediate, and  in the presence of oxygen it can undergo a spontaneous decarboxylation, producing |FRAME: DIACETYL| that is converted to acetoin by the activity of the dual-function enzyme acetoin (diacetyl) reductase (see below).
Under anaerobic conditions  |FRAME: 2-ACETO-LACTATE| is converted directly to acetoin by a decarboxylation step catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-5262| (&alpha;-ALD), and production of diacetyl is bypassed.

Diacetyl can be converted into any of the two stereoisomers of acetoin - |FRAME: CPD-10353| or |FRAME: CPD-255|, by stereo-specific enzymes.

The enzymes that catalyze the irreversible reduction of diacetyl to acetoin also catalyze the last step in the pathway - the reversible conversion of acetoin to 2,3-butanediol. These enzymes are known in the literature by several names, including acetoin reductase (AR), acetoin (diacetyl) reductase, and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH). Four types of AR activites have been described, differing in their stereo-specificity for both the substrate and the product:

1. An |FRAME: CPD-12004|-forming R-acetoin reductase

2. An |FRAME: CPD-12004|-forming S-acetoin reductase

3. An |FRAME: CPD-346|-forming S-acetoin reductase

4. An |FRAME: BUTANEDIOL|-forming R-acetoin reductase.

Among the enzymes that have been characteized, some appear to have only one of these activities, while others have multiple activities |CITS: [Ui84]|.

The two enzyme activities diacetyl reductase and acetoin reductase were initially reported to be catalyzed by two different enzymes |CITS: [13211662]|, and two different EC numbers were issued based on that observation (|FRAME: ACETOINDEHYDROG-RXN \"EC 1.1.1.5\"| and |FRAME: RR-BUTANEDIOL-DEHYDROGENASE-RXN \"EC 1.1.1.4|). However, later research indicated that in most bacteria both activities are catalyzed by the same enzyme, for which the name diacetyl(acetoin) reductase was suggested |CITS: [5540507][4350968][2040298][10647818]|. Moreover, the enzyme appears to have a much wider substrate range than orignally believed, and it has been suggested to rename it L-glycol dehydrogenase |CITS: [2040298]|.

Yeast appears to also have dedicated NADP-linked enzymes that reduce diacetyl but not acetoin |CITS: [2180695]|.

This pathway includes multiple decarboxylation reactions, generating |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6282"	"palmitoleate biosynthesis I (from (5Z)-dodec-5-enoate)"	"PWY-6282"	"|FRAME: CPD-9245 Palmitoleate| is a common unsaturated fatty acid, found in bacteria, fungi |CITS: [8294460]|, plants |CITS: [7548115]| and animals |CITS:[14321753] [6030882]|. It is formed in different organisms by different mechanisms. Only bacteria can produce unsaturated fatty acids anaerobically, and thus the key enzymes of this pathway (particularly |FRAME: EG10273| which catalyzes an early step - see |FRAME: PWY0-862|) have been targeted for development of new antibacterial agents |CITS: [22188524][23174186]|.

In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: CPD-9245| is one of only two unsaturated fatty acids (along with |FRAME: CPD-9247|), which together comprise about one-half of the total fatty acid content of the organism. |FRAME: PALMITATE Palmitate|, |FRAME: CPD-9245|, and |FRAME: CPD-9247| make up the bulk of the fatty acids found in |FRAME:TAX-562| membranes |CITS: [8246839]|.

|FRAME:TAX-562| has three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS): |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.

The extension of |FRAME: Cis-delta-3-decenoyl-ACPs| to |FRAME: Palmitoleoyl-ACPs| is believed to be catalyzed primarily by |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG10274|). Inactivation of this enzyme leads to a lack of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [4901354]|. On the other hand, overexpression of KASI leads to the overproduction of |FRAME: CPD-9247| |CITS: [6337151]|.

It has been shown that the basal ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in |FRAME:TAX-562| is controlled by the level of two enzymes - |FRAME: FABA-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG10273|) and |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG10274|) |CITS: [8246839]|. The former introduces unsaturation (see |FRAME: PWY0-862|), while the other elongates the unsaturated fatty acid to the level of |FRAME: Palmitoleoyl-ACPs| (this pathway).

Additional control over this ratio is provided by temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in |FRAME:TAX-562| with lower growth temperature, a phenomenon found in most organisms that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures.
It has been shown that |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG12606|), which is responsible for the further elongation of the unsaturated fatty acids to the final level of |FRAME: CPD-9247| (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|), is more active at low temperatures (relative to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative increase results in the production of |FRAME: CPD-9247| rather than |FRAME: CPD-9245|.
Because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of di-unsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|.

|FRAME: CPD-9245| is also found in some plants. For the biosynthesis of this compound in plants, see |FRAME: PWY-5366|."

While |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| is a common fatty acid in other organisms, where it is produced by oxygen-dependent desaturase enzymes, it is unusual in bacteria.

The pathway used by the bacteria to produce these fatty acids has been studied in |FRAME: TAX-1377| |CITS: [23972938]|. It is similar to the pathway used by many bacteria to produce |FRAME: CPD-17910| (see |FRAME: PWY0-862|). The key enzyme of that pathway is |FRAME: EC-5.3.3.14| (|FRAME: EG10273 FabA|), which has the unique ability of converting some of the |FRAME: Trans-D2-decenoyl-ACPs \"(2E)-dec-2-enoyl-[acp]\"| (an intermediate the |FRAME: PWY-5971 \"palmitate biosynthesis\"| pathway) to |FRAME: Cis-delta-3-decenoyl-ACPs \"(3Z)-dec-3-enoyl-[acp]\"|, which is then elongated in the usual fatty acid elongation process to form |FRAME: Cis-Delta5-dodecenoyl-ACPs \"(5Z)-dodec-5-enoyl-[acp]\"|. 

In the case of bacterial oleate prduction, the key step in the pathway is a similar isomerization, but of a later intermediate of the palmitate biosynthesis pathway, |FRAME: Dodec-2-enoyl-ACPs|, which contains a longer acyl chain. The enzyme catalyzing the isomerization reaction in |FRAME: TAX-1377| is a unique hydratase/isomerase, encoded by |FRAME: G-44009|, which fulfils the roles of both |FRAME: EG11284| (the hydratase involved in the fatty acid elongation process) and |FRAME: EG10273|, which is essential for production of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [23972938]|.
The enzyme responsible for the isomerization in |FRAME: TAX-1520| is still unknown, as it has been shown that the fabZ homolog in that organism is unable to perform the isomerization reaction |CITS: [19493359]|.

Another key enzyme in bacterial anaerobic unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis is the enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of the FabA (or FabQ) product with malonyl-[acp], thus allowing the fatty acid elongation enzymes to continue the extension of the unsaturated fatty acid by two carbons. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this activity is provided by |FRAME: EG10274 FabB|. In |FRAME: TAX-1377|, which lacks FabB, this activity is carried out by a trifunctional |FRAME: G-44012 FabF| enzyme, which catalyzes the activities of the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG10277| and |FRAME: EG12606| |CITS: [23972938]|.

Three rounds of the sequential action of FabF - FabG - FabQ - FabK generate |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD|, as shown in this pathway.

Only bacteria can produce unsaturated fatty acids anaerobically, and thus the key enzymes of this pathway (particularly |FRAME: EG10273 FabA|) have been targeted for development of new antibacterial agents |CITS: [22188524][23174186]|.

The pathway was originally characterized in the &gamma;-proteobacterium |FRAME: TAX-562|. In that organism, two dehydratases, |FRAME: EG10273 FabA| and |FRAME: EG11284 FabZ|, function for the most part interchangeably in converting |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP \"(3<i>R</i>)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier protein]\"| of various chain lengths, saturated or unsaturated, to the corresponding |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP \"<i>trans</i>-2-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein]\"| forms. However, |FRAME: EG10273 FabA| alone has the unique ability of converting some of the <i>trans</i> form |FRAME: Trans-D2-decenoyl-ACPs \"(2<i>E</i>)-dec-2-enoyl-[acp]\"| produced to the <i>cis</i> form |FRAME: Cis-delta-3-decenoyl-ACPs \"(3Z)-dec-3-enoyl-[acyl-carrier protein]\"|.

While the <i>trans</i> form can be reduced and elongated leading to saturated fatty acids, the <i>cis</i>-form cannot be reduced. Instead it serves directly as a substrate for the condensing enzyme, |FRAME: EG10274 FabB|, producing a product that can be acted on by the regular fatty acid elongation enzymes, resulting in an unsaturated acid with a chain  lengthened by two carbon atoms. As might be predicted, mutant strains unable to produce active FabA are unable to make unsaturated fatty acids, but make a normal complement of saturated fatty acids.

It should be noted that only &alpha;- and &gamma;-proteobacteria have the <i>fabA</i> and <i>fabB</i> genes. Other bacterial species that produce unsaturated fatty acids anaerobically possess alternative enzymes, such as |FRAME: G-44021| and |FRAME: G-44022| in |FRAME: TAX-1351| |CITS: [15194690]| and |FRAME: G-44020| in |FRAME: TAX-1313| |CITS: [12237320]|.

Repeated cycling of these four elongation reactions eventually lead to the unsaturated fatty acids |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247| that are incorporated into various lipids (see pathways |FRAME: PWY-6282| and |FRAME: PWY-5973|)."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5989"	"stearate biosynthesis II (bacteria and plants)"	"PWY-5989"	"|FRAME: STEARIC_ACID Stearate| is a saturated fatty acid that occurs in many animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is an important constituent of milk fats, lard, and cocoa and shea butters. Stearate was first described by Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1823, and its name comes from Greek for \"hard fat\", reflecting the fact that stearate forms a waxy solid |CITS: [16477801]|.

<i>De novo</i> plant fatty acid synthesis occurs primarily in plastids and chloroplasts (it was shown that at least in Arabidopsis fatty acid synthesis also occurs in the mitochondria). The process involves a series of reactions catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FAS) complexes that provoke the condensation of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| and |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|).

In animals the last [acp]-bound intermediate appears to be |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs \"palmitoyl-[acp]\"|, and elongation to |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| proceeds via CoA-bound intermediates in the ER (see |FRAME: PWY-5972|). In bacteria and plants elongation to stearate appears to continue via [acp]-bound intermediates, and |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs \"stearoyl-[acp]\"| has been detected in many species |CITS: [4831331]|. 
At least in plants, the elongation from |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs \"palmitoyl-[acp]\"| to |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs \"stearoyl-[acp]\"| is catalyzed by a dedicated &beta;-ketoacyl-[acp] synthase, encoded by |FRAME: G-10790| (The enzyme involved in <i>de novo</i> fatty acid synthesis system up to |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs \"palmitoyl-[acp]\"| is encoded by |FRAME: AT5G46290|) |CITS: [4153356][11337402]|.

|FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs \"Strearoyl-[acp]\"| can be hydrolyzed by acyl-ACP thioesterase enzymes |CITS: [7734968]|. However, before the fatty acids can be exported out of the chloroplast they must be activated to fatty acyl-CoAs by an outer envelope |FRAME: AT1G77590| activity. Once activated, they are exported to the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [14973169]|.

A more common route involves desaturation of |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| to |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD|. Plants contain acyl-ACP desaturase enzymes, which introduce a double bond in the 9 position of |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs \"stearoyl-[acp]\"| to generate |FRAME: Oleoyl-ACPs \"oleoyl-[acp]\"| (see |FRAME: PWY-5147|). Stearate is the only fatty acid that is desaturated in its ACP-bound form. All other desaturation reactions occur only after the fatty acid has been attached to a glycerolipid backbone.

In cyanobacteria stearate is also often desaturated to oleate. However, unlike plants, in cyanobacteria this desaturation reaction occurs only after the incorporation of stearate into a lipid. Prior to incorporation into a lipid, the fatty acid is transferred to a coenzyme A molecule, resulting in formation of |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|.

Since the activity of the desaturase enzymes is often very high, |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| is often the main product of intraplastidial fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [8652653]|."

The only phospholipid found in chloroplast thylakoids is |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL \"phosphatidylglycerol\"|, which is critical for the structural and functional integrity of the thylakoid membranes.

The acyl donors for the two acyltransferase reactions leading to the formation of |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE|, the precursor of phosphatidylglycerol, can be either an acyl-ACP or an acyl-CoA, depending on the location of the pathway. In plants the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol can occur at three subcellular locations - chloroplast, mitochondrion and ER. In the plastid phosphatidylglycerol is assembled <i>de novo</i> from the newly synthesized fatty acids, and acyl-ACPs are the acyl donors |CITS: [16774646]|.
In the non-plastidic pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-8|) acyl-CoA are used as the acyl-donor |CITS: [Moore82]|.

In Arabidopsis, this pathway accounts for about 85% of phosphatidylglycerol in the plastid.

The acyl donors for the two acyltransferase reactions leading to the formation of |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE|, the precursor of phosphatidylglycerol, can be either an acyl-ACP or an acyl-CoA, depending on the location of the pathway. In plants the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol can occur at three subcellular locations - chloroplast, mitochondrion and ER. In the plastid (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-7|), phosphatidylglycerol is assembled <i>de novo</i> from the newly synthesized fatty acids, and acyl-ACPs are the acyl donors |CITS: [16774646]|.
In the non-plastidic pathway depicted here acyl-CoA are used as the acyl-donor |CITS: [Moore82]|.

Phospholipids are important membrane components. Most of the phospholipids belong to the category of phosphoglycerides. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as phosphatidates, are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group.
The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on carbon-1 and carbon-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to carbon-3 by an ester link.
Phosphatidates are precursors for many phosphoglycerides found in animals, plants and yeast, including |FRAME: Phosphatidylinositols|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-SERINE|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN|.

As part of the synthesis of phosphoglycerides, either the phosphatidate or the modifying compound need to be activated by |FRAME:CTP|. In some cases, the modifying compound is activated, as in the case of |FRAME: CHOLINE| and |FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|, which form |FRAME: CDP-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: CDP-ETHANOLAMINE|, respectively. However, in the case of other compounds, such as |FRAME: SER| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, the phosphatidate is activated first, forming |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|, which then reacts with the modifying compound to form the phosphoglyceride.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| in some Gram-negative bacteria (primarily the |FRAME: TAX-1236|) as well as the chloroplasts of green plants. In this pathway the production of the intermediate |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P| is catalyzed by a type of the membrane-bound enzyme |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER| that uses |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| as the acyl donor.

Bacteria enzymes that can utilze |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| are found only in some Gram-negative bacteria.
They are encoded by the |FRAME: EG10740| gene, and can also utilize |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs| thioesters. The plasitidic enzyme can use only |FRAME: ACYL-ACP| |CITS: [9370311]|.

The addition of the second acyl moiety is catalyzed by |FRAME: 1-ACYLGLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|. The bacterial enzyme, which is universally expressed in all bacteria, is encoded by |FRAME: EG11377|.
As in the case of PlsB, it can utilize either a fatty acyl-[acp] or an acyl-CoA thioester as the acyl donor.

A pathway that describes the usage of acyl-CoA donors can be found at |FRAME: PWY-5667|.
It should be noted that most bacteria utilize a different route for the synthesis of |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5981|.

Many organisms produce large complex polymers that contain |FRAME: Uronates \"uronic acids\"|. A few examples include |FRAME: Pectin pectin|, an important component of  plant cell walls that contains |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE|, and glycosaminoglycans produced by animals, which include |FRAME: HEPARIN|, |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate|, |FRAME: Hyaluronan|, |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| etc.

The bacterial degradation pathways for these polymers usually invovle an intial attack on the polymer that breaks it into short oligosaccharides. Two main types of enzymes that perform this task are the hydrolases and the endolyases. While hydrolases produce oligosaccharides that contain sugar residues similar to those in the polymer, lyases produce oligosaccharides that have a 4-5 unsaturated uronic acid at their non-reducing end. This is typically followed by the action of exolyases or hydrolases that cleave the oligosaccharides, resulting in the production of unstable unsaturated mono uronic acid monomers. Two forms of unsaturated uronic acids are formed, depending on the stereochemistry of the original acid - |FRAME: CPD-17705| and |FRAME: CPD-13122|. The degradation of many polymers, including gellan, rhamnogalacturan, pectin, heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronan and chondroitin results in formation the latter. |FRAME: CPD-13122| is unstable and the ring opens spontaneously, forming the keto acid |FRAME: CPD-37|. This pathway describes the degradation of that intermediate to metabolites of central metabolism.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway, which was first studied in detail in the pectin degrader |FRAME: TAX-556|, begins with the isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-37| (DKI) to |FRAME: CPD-343| (DKII). The <i>kduI</i> gene encoding the isomerase has been identified in this organism |CITS: [1766386]|, but the enzyme has not been characterized. Earlier work characterized this enzyme in a pseudomonad |CITS: [13986017]|. |FRAME: CPD-343| is reduced to the common metabolite |FRAME: 2-DEHYDRO-3-DEOXY-D-GLUCONATE|, a compound that is also an intermediate in |FRAME: GALACTUROCAT-PWY|. |FRAME: 2-DEHYDRO-3-DEOXY-D-GLUCONATE| is phosphorylated and then cleaved by an aldolase encoded by the <i>kdgA</i> gene, producing the central metabolites |FRAME: GAP| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|.

The same pathway has also been characterized from the heparin/hyaluronan-degradating bacterium |FRAME: TAX-211110| |CITS: [25605731]|. Two of the enzymes (|FRAME: EC-5.3.1.17| and |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.127|) have been characterized in detail from this organism. While their actions are identical to those of the |FRAME: TAX-556| enzymes, they share very little sequence similarity and possess different structures, suggesting parallel evolution. The |FRAME: G-14833| and |FRAME: G-12012| genes are found in enterococci and clostridia, while the |FRAME: G-43933| and |FRAME: G-43934| genes are much less common and found primarily in streptococci |CITS: [25605731]|.

In |FRAME:TAX-562| the aldolase encoded by gene <i>eda</i> is involved in the |FRAME: ENTNER-DOUDOROFF-PWY|.
However, in |FRAME: TAX-556| this enzyme does not appear to be involved in |FRAME: GLUCONATE| catabolism and no product of the <i>edd</i> gene that encodes the |FRAME: PGLUCONDEHYDRAT-MONOMER| could be detected in various species of |FRAME:TAX-551|. These observations question the existence of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in these organisms (|CITS: [8145647][8905080]|. 

Most of the enzymes in this pathway are controlled by <i>kdgR</i> a transcriptional regulator that is induced by |FRAME: 2-DEHYDRO-3-DEOXY-D-GLUCONATE| |CITS: [1840643] [1874406]|.  A comparative genomics analysis of the <i>kdgR</i> regulon in eight enterobacteria including |FRAME: TAX-198628| and |FRAME: TAX-554| and two members of the genus |FRAME:TAX-662|, yielded a metabolic map of pectin and pectin-derivative degradation in these organisms |CITS: [15528647]|."

One group of such pathways is the degradation of glucuronate-containing polymers such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans|. These pathways contain a step for the removal of |FRAME: GLUCURONATE| residues, which are then converted to |FRAME: FRUCTURONATE| by the action of |FRAME: EC-5.3.1.12| |CITS: [13794771]|.

In the hyper thermophilic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-2336|, the degradation of |FRAME: Pectin pectin|, which results in formation of |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE|, also feeds into |FRAME: FRUCTURONATE|, since |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| is isomerized to |FRAME: D-TAGATURONATE| by |FRAME: CPLX-8661|, which is then epimerized to |FRAME: FRUCTURONATE| by |FRAME: CPLX-8660| |CITS: [22925190]|.

Another |FRAME: TAX-2336| pathway that leads to |FRAME: FRUCTURONATE| is the degradation of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| |CITS: [23441918]|.

|FRAME: FRUCTURONATE| is converted in three steps (dehydrogenation, dehydration, and phosphorylation) to |FRAME: 2-KETO-3-DEOXY-6-P-GLUCONATE|, which is then cleaved by |FRAME: EC-4.1.2.14| to form the central metabolites |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|, leading to the TCA cycle and glycolysis (the last two steps are known as the |FRAME: PWY-2221 \"semi-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway\"|)."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-1298"	"superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides degradation"	"PWY0-1298"	"|FRAME:TAX-562| can use all three naturally occurring pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides (deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, and
thymidine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  Deoxyuridine and thymidine are cleaved by a specific
phosphorylase, yielding a pyrimidine base and D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate, which is converted to
D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that also can utilize D-ribose-1-phosphate as a substrate.  A specific
aldolase splits D-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, yielding D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which enters central
metabolism through the glycolytic pathway, and acetaldehyde, which must be converted to acetyl-CoA before it can
enter central metabolism.  It does so via the TCA cycle.  In contrast, |FRAME:TAX-562| lacks a specific phosphorylase
capable of cleaving deoxycytidine.  This nucleoside must be deaminated (thereby yielding deoxyuridine) before it can
be cleaved.

Although |FRAME:TAX-562| is able to utilize the deoxyribose moiety of deoxyribonucleosides, it is unable to utilize
exogenously supplied deoxyribose; however, the closely related organism |FRAME:TAX-90371| can.

The amino nitrogen of cytidine but not the ring-nitrogen of uracil or thymine, generated as by-products of this
pathway, can serve as a total nitrogen source for |FRAME:TAX-562| over its entire temperature range of growth.  However,
these ring nitrogens do become available to serve as total nitrogen sources at room temperature via a pathway
encoded by genes in the <i>rut</i> operon |CITS: [16540542]|.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5695"	"inosine 5'-phosphate degradation"	"PWY-5695"	"Nitrogen is frequently the limiting nutrient for growth of many crop plants. Legumes solved this problem by establishing a symbiotic relationship with bacteria from the genus |FRAME: TAX-374|, which contain the enzyme nitrogenase.
Nitrogenase catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric |FRAME: NITROGEN-MOLECULE| to |FRAME: AMMONIA|, which can be used to meet the plant's metabolic nitrogen requirements (see |FRAME: N2FIX-PWY|).

The ammonia generated by the bacteria is first converted into the amino acid |FRAME:GLN| and then incorporated into |FRAME: IMP| (IMP), a purine synthesized <i>de novo</i> during nitrogen fixation by roots (see |FRAME: PWY-841|).

Before the fixed nitrogen can be used by the plant, it must be converted into organic forms that can be transported throughout the plant and further metabolized.
There are two major forms of organic nitrogen compounds that can be transported - amides (such as |FRAME:ASN| and |FRAME:GLN|) and ureides (such as |FRAME: ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|).
Temperate-region legumes, such as pea, are amide exporters, while legumes of tropical origin, such as soybean, kidney bean and peanut, export nitrogen in the form of ureides (see |FRAME: URSIN-PWY|). 

The pathway that is described here, the conversion of |FRAME:IMP| to |FRAME:URATE|, is part of the pathway leading to the production of ureides in plants. However, it is also a part of the degradation of purines, which is found in many organisms.
Many mammals, for example, can mineralize purines completely to TCA cycle building blocks in a pathway that includes this subpathway. Humans and apes possess this pathway, but do not have the enzyne urate oxidase (|FRAME: URATE-OXIDASE-RXN \"EC 1.7.3.3\"|, and thus accumulate urate, which has to be disposed of via urine."

xanthosine) as total sources of carbon and energy.  The first three (adenosine, guanosine, and inosine) are cleaved
by the same <i>deoD</i>-encoded phosphorylase, yielding the corresponding purine bases (adenine, guanine, and
hypoxanthine) and D-ribose-1-phosphate, which, after being converted to D-ribose-5-phosphate by a mutase that
also can utilize D-deoxyribose-1-phosphate as a substrate, enters central metabolism through the nonoxidative
branch of the pentose phosphate pathway.  In contrast, xanthosine is cleaved by a specific phosphorylase encoded
by <i>xapA</i> before it enters the same pathway.  Adenosine may be deaminated before it enters the pathway.

The amino nitrogens of adenosine and guanine, but not the ring-nitrogen of any of the four purines, generated as a
by-product of this pathway, can serve as a total nitrogen source for |FRAME:TAX-562|.

|FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE \"Protocatechuate\"| is one of the key intermediate metabolites in the microbial degradation of various aromatic compounds, including phthalates, hydroxybenzoates, and lignin-derived aromatic compounds such as |FRAME: VANILLATE| and |FRAME: FERULIC-ACID|.

The key step in these degradation pathways, the fission of the protocatechuate aromatic ring, can be catalyzed by one of the three distinct dioxygenases |FRAME: CPLX-2701|, |FRAME: CPLX-2721| and |FRAME: CPLX-7915|.
The fission products, and thus the degradation pathways, depend on the type of dioxygenase employed. The three pathways are described in |FRAME: P184-PWY|, |FRAME: PROTOCATECHUATE-ORTHO-CLEAVAGE-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-6336|, respectively.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway that starts with |FRAME: CPLX-2721| is part of a pathway known as the |FRAME: PWY-5431 \"3-oxoadipate pathway\"| (or &beta;-ketoadipate pathway). It is widely distributed among soil bacteria and fungi |CITS: [8905091]|, although the pathway organization and regulation varies among species |CITS: [8905091]|.  

The &beta;-ketoadipate pathway is comprised of two parallel branches, one branch converts |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| to |FRAME: 3-KETO-ADIPATE| and the other converts |FRAME: CATECHOL| to |FRAME: 3-KETO-ADIPATE|.  |FRAME: 3-KETO-ADIPATE| is then converted to |FRAME: SUC-COA| and |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, which are processed by the TCA cycle.

A variety of aromatic compounds, such as 4-hydroxybenzoate and benzoate, are shuttled into the respective protocatechuate and catechol branches of the &beta;-ketoadipate pathway.

In |FRAME: TAX-303|, all of the enzymes involved in protocatechuate degradation via the &beta;-ketoadipate pathway are inducible |CITS: [5916393]|.  
Protocatechuate dioxygenase is induced by protocatechuate (as reported in |CITS: [8905091]|, 
and the remaining five enzymes, 3-carboxymuconate cycloisomerase, 4-carboxymuconolactone
decarboxylase, &beta;-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase, &beta;-ketoadipate:succinyl-CoA transferase, and
&beta;-ketoadipyl CoA thiolase are induced by &beta;-ketoadipate |CITS: [5916393][8905091]|. 

The genes that encode for the synthesis of the regulatory proteins and the enzymes of the protocatechuate 
branch of the &beta;-ketoadipate pathway in <i>P. putida</i> are clustered into four distinct groups 
(as reported in |CITS: [7961399]|):  pcaHG |CITS: [8407791]|, 
pcaBDC |CITS: [1390752]|, pcaIJ |CITS: [8376330]|, and pcaRKF |CITS: [761399]|.  In

In aquatic organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia (ammonotelism), while land-dwelling organisms developed ways to convert the toxic ammonia to either urea (ureotelism) or uric acid (uricotelism). Generally, birds and saurian reptiles excrete uric acid, while the remaining species, including mammals, excrete urea |CITS:[13672961][13672962]|. Remarkably, tadpoles excrete ammonia, and shift to urea production during metamorphosis
|CITS:[13672962]|.

The urea is formed in the livers of mammals in a cyclic pathway which was initially named the Krebs-Henseleit cycle after its discoverers, and later became known simply as the urea cycle. This cycle was partially deduced by Krebs and Henseleit in 1932 |CITS: [Krebs32]| and was clarified in the 1940s as the roles of citrulline and argininosuccinate as intermediates were understood |CITS:[3545062]|.

In this cycle, amino groups donated by |FRAME:AMMONIA| and |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE| are converted to |FRAME:UREA|, while |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, |FRAME:L-CITRULLINE|, |FRAME:L-ARGININO-SUCCINATE|, and |FRAME:ARG| act as intermediates.

Despite the generalization above, the pathway has been documented not only in mammals and amphibians, but in many other organisms as well, including birds |CITS:[4217066]|, invertebrates |CITS:[14465664][5869779]|, insects |CITS: [697760][5791517]|, plants |CITS: [13741005] [13958361]|, yeast |CITS:[11946245]|, fungi |CITS:[4996649]|, and even microorganisms |CITS:[5593971][5709377]|."

This pathway represents the \"core\" cycle of &beta;-oxidation, a mechanism that removes two carbon atoms with each turn of the cycle. 

Saturated fatty acids that are routed into this core pathway are processed until only two or three carbons remain. When even-numbered fatty acids are broken down, the final product is the two-carbon compound |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, which is a basic intermediate of central metabolism, and can be routed into the |FRAME: TCA \"TCA cycle\"| for complete catabolism or routed into the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS| to be used for biosynthesis.
When odd number fatty acids are broken down, the final product of the pathway is the three-carbon compound |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA|, which in |FRAME:TAX-562| is carboxylated to |FRAME: Methylmalonyl-CoA| and converted to |FRAME: SUC-COA| (see |FRAME: PROPIONMET-PWY|). 

Unsaturated fatty acids with <i>cis</i> double bonds located at odd-numbered carbon atoms enter the main pathway after a modification (see |FRAME: PWY-5137|). When <i>cis</i> double bonds are located at even-numbered carbon atoms (such as in |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID|), the acids are modified by a different route (see |FRAME: PWY-5138|).

In the facultative anaerobic bacterium |FRAME:TAX-562| the pathway can proceed under anaerobic conditions |CITS: [12535077]|.

<i>Pseudomonas</i>. 

The most comprehensively studied <i>meta</i>-cleavage pathway is that of the TOL plasmid pWWO,
which encodes a toluene degradation pathway in |FRAME: TAX-303|.
The genes are located in an operon that encodes the enzymes for conversion of benzoate to catechol,
and catechol to the cenrtal metabolites pyruvate and acetaldehyde |CITS: [2183008]|.

|FRAME: CATECHOL \"Catechol\"| itself is an intermediate in the degradation of many different aromatic compounds.
In addition to |FRAME:BENZOATE|, including toluate, |FRAME:NAPHTHALENE|, |FRAME:CPD-110|, and |FRAME: PHENOL|, and substituted catechols are intermediates in the catabolism of methylated and chlorinated derivatives
of these compounds.

In this pathway, the aromatic ring of |FRAME:CATECHOL| is cleaved by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-2841|
adjacent to the two catechol hydroxyls.
The product of this cleavage, |FRAME:HYDROXYMUCONATE-SALD|, can be metabolized in two routes. In the variant described in this pathway, it is hydrolyzed by |FRAME:MONOMER-12763|, generating the important intermediate |FRAME:OXOPENTENOATE| in a single step.

In the second variant (see |FRAME:PWY-5420|), |FRAME:HYDROXYMUCONATE-SALD| is dehydrogenated by |FRAME:CPLX-7245| to the enol-form of 4-oxalocrotonate, which is then isomerized by |FRAME:CPLX-7237| to the keto-form, and decarboxylated by |FRAME:CPLX-7239|. The later is in a tight complex with the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-7240|. It's product, |FRAME:CPD-6761|, is an unstable tautomer of |FRAME:OXOPENTENOATE|. This product is transferred to |FRAME: CPLX-7240| within the complex.

|FRAME:OXOPENTENOATE| (or its tautomer |FRAME:CPD-6761|).

(see |FRAME:PWY-5430|), or the <i>ortho</i>-cleavage pathway (this pathway).
When degraded by this pathway, catechol is cleaved between the two ring hydroxyls by the enzyme
|FRAME:CPLX-2842| forming |FRAME:CIS-CIS-MUCONATE|, which is then further metabolyzed in three
steps to the important intermediate |FRAME:3-KETO-ADIPATE|.

|FRAME:3-KETO-ADIPATE| is a convergence point of the two branches of the &beta;-ketoadipate
pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5431|); one of the branches is this pathway, while the other one starts
with protocatechuate (see |FRAME:PROTOCATECHUATE-ORTHO-CLEAVAGE-PWY|.
Once &beta;-Ketoadipate is formed, it is converted to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA.  

The pathway is widely distributed among soil bacteria and fungi, even though its
organization and regulation vary among species |CITS:[15421941][8905091][3941043][16885292]|.
For example, in |FRAME: TAX-303| the genes that encode the regulatory proteins and the enzymes
of this pathway are clustered into two distinct groups |CITS: [761399]|, while in |FRAME: TAX-471| they
are arranged in a single cluster induced by protocatechuate |CITS: [7961399]|.

In |FRAME: TAX-303| the enzymes involved in &beta;-ketoadipate degradation
(|FRAME:CPLX-2722|, and |FRAME:CPLX-7260|) are inducible by |FRAME:3-KETO-ADIPATE|

by bacteria was first suggested by Kilby, who reported its accumulation in cultures of
|FRAME:TAX-475| growing on phenol |CITS: [Kilby48]|.
This observation was confirmed by the demonstration that cell-free extracts of |FRAME: TAX-303|,
induced by growth on aromatic precursors, can convert both catechol or protocatechuate
to |FRAME:3-KETO-ADIPATE| |CITS: [15421941]|.

The pathway is widely distributed among bacteria |CITS: [4599397]|. It consists of two parallel branches
for the dissimilation of |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| and |FRAME:CATECHOL|.
While the enzymes of the pathway from different microorganisms share common ancestry
|CITS:[4199895][4199896][4215816]|, many different gene organizations
and forms of regulation have evolved |CITS: [1624453]|."

|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|  (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent
findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well |CITS: [15003233]|. In animals and plants GABA is produced by the cytosolic enzyme |FRAME: GLUTDECARBOX-RXN \"glutamate decarboxylase\"|.

The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|. Diiferent variants of both enzymes are known. The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]|) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862| |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|). Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirement, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.

The action of glutamate decarboxylase, &gamma;-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and succinate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase, combined, defines a short pathway known as the \"GABA shunt\", since it can channel glutamate into the |FRAME: TCA|, bypassing two steps of that cycle.  

While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capabillity to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria can synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation \"putrescine degradation\"|). 
The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|
|CITS:[13654294][13654295]|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source |CITS: [8951816][12123465]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

When the fate of |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| was studied in |FRAME: TAX-1511|, a strict anaerobe isolated from North Carolina swamp mud |CITS:[14399736]|, a different pathway was observed.
Among the products produced by this strain were |FRAME:4-HYDROXY-BUTYRATE|, |FRAME:AMMONIA|, and |FRAME:ACET|. While the first step of the pathway was found to be identical to that in |FRAME: TAX-294|, the second
step was different: In |FRAME: TAX-1511| |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD| is converted to |FRAME:4-HYDROXY-BUTYRATE|. The |FRAME:GLT| formed during the transamination of |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| is converted back to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, liberating |FRAME:AMMONIA| in the process |CITS:[13952769]|.

Recently the |FRAME: G-10272|, |FRAME: G-10271|  and |FRAME: G-10270| genes, encoding |FRAME: MONOMER-13486|, |FRAME: CPLX-7514| and |FRAME: CPLX-7515|, respectively, were cloned and expressed in |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [11041350]|. These are the first |FRAME: TAX-33953| proteins with a known gene sequence.

|FRAME: Vitamins-B6 Vitamin B6| is a group term for |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| (PL), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| (PN), |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE| (PM) and their 5'-phosphorylated derivatives |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| (PLP), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE-5P| (PNP) and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| (PMP), which are also referred to as vitamers. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form, and is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has recently been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [11701851]|.  Most bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|, although some bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, use a longer, more complex pathway (|FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [9696782][12896974]|. Animals do not synthesize this compound, making it an essential nutrient in their diet.

PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors and participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. In humans this vitamin has a role in numerous functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to potent antioxidant activity.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The biosynthesis of this vitamin was thoroughly studied in |FRAME:TAX-562| and involves two branches with seven enzymatic steps. In one branch, the sequential action of the enzymes Epd, PdxB and SerC results in the convesrion of erythrose 4-phosphate into 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine. The latter then undergoes oxidation and decarboxylation by PdxA to form 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate. In the other branch, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) is derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate by the action of Dxs. The products of the two branches, i.e. 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and DXP, are then condensed by PdxJ to form PNP, which enters the salvage pathway to undergo oxidation by PdxH to form the PLP cofactor.

From the six pdx genes, two of them, <i>epd</i> and <i>serC</i>, are involved in other metabolic processes, but <i>pdxA</i>, <i>pdxB</i>, <i>pdxJ</i> and <i>pdxH</i> are unique for PLP biosynthesis |CITS: [1537800]|. PdxJ, the PNP synthase is the key ezyme that catalyzes a multistep ring closure yielding PNP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This is the last step in the <i>de novo</i> synthetic pathway.

This topic has been reviewed in |CITS: [17822383][15242009][12686115]|.

|FRAME: Ubiquinones Ubiquinone| (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (<i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate|, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via either a |FRAME: MEP-Pathways \"\"methylerythritol phosphate pathway\"| or a |FRAME: Mevalonate-Pathways \"mevalonate pathway\"|, which feed isoprene units into the |FRAME: Polyprenyl-Biosynthesis| pathways.

The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example, |FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 such subunits, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10. The ubiquinones are often named according to the number of carbons in the side chain (e.g. ubi-30) or the number of isoprenoid subunits (e.g. Q-10).

Following addition of the polyprenyl tail, the product (4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate), is processed in three steps, namely decarboxylation, oxidation, and methylation. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways differ in the order of these steps: in eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated prior to decarboxylation; in prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation and methylation |CITS: [Shepherd96]|.

The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that accumulate pathway intermediates; some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

|FRAME: UBIQUINONE-8 Ubiquinone 8| (Q-8) is a common form of ubiquinone among bacteria. Most of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, such as the enterobacteria, produce Q-8 (in addition to |FRAME: CPD-9728| and |FRAME: DEMETHYLMENAQUINONE|). Q-8 has been documented in several strains of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [13673033]|,
|FRAME: TAX-546|, |FRAME: TAX-548|, |FRAME: TAX-554|, |FRAME: TAX-584|, |FRAME: TAX-585| |CITS: [4886765]| and |FRAME: TAX-615| |CITS: [Bezborodov69]|, as well as in the non-eneterobacteria |FRAME: TAX-644|, |FRAME: TAX-648| |CITS: [4886765]| and |FRAME: TAX-51367| |CITS: [Collins81]|. It is also common in aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-354| |CITS:[13673033] [4288128]|, |FRAME: TAX-353| |CITS: [13869492]|, |FRAME: TAX-107673| |CITS: [Denis75]|, |FRAME: TAX-520| |CITS: [4351160]|, |FRAME: TAX-106590| |CITS: [Yamada68]|, and various
|FRAME: TAX-338| strains |CITS: [Ikemoto80]|. Q-8 was also found to be the major quinone in an unidentified strain of the gliding bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1021| |CITS: [Carr67]| and in some phototrophic bacteria, including |FRAME:TAX-1049|
|CITS:[14240125]|, |FRAME:TAX-1053|, |FRAME: TAX-28068| |CITS: [Carr65][5727384]|, and a strain of |FRAME: TAX-1081| |CITS: [5727384]|. Q-8 is often found as a secondary quinone in |FRAME: TAX-286| strains |CITS: [4886765]|.

The best studied ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway is that of |FRAME: TAX-83333|, which produces a |FRAME: UBIQUINONE-8|. The first committed step of the pathway is the conversion of chorismate to |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate|
by |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER|. The enzyme retains and is efficiently inhibited by the product of the reaction, 4-hydroxybenzoate, which may present a control mechanism for the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway or a mechanism for delivery of 4-hydroxybenzoate to the membrane |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.

The second step in the pathway is the transfer of the polyisoprenoid tail onto |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate| by the membrane-bound |FRAME: 4OHBENZOATE-OCTAPRENYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|. This is followed by the
decarboxylation of the ring structure by |FRAME: CPLX0-301| (or possibly by UbiX) to form |FRAME: 2-OCTAPRENYLPHENOL|.  Under anaerobic conditions, this compound accumulates in the membrane and is not converted into ubiquinone. Further steps in the pathway require the presence of dioxygen |CITS: [361395]|.

Following is the alternating introduction of three hydroxyl- and three methyl groups. With the exception of the methyltransferase that catalyzes both of the <i>O</i>-methyltransferase reactions, UbiG, none of the enzymes have been studied biochemically and their substrate and cofactor requirements are still unknown. The hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by different types of enzymes in different bacterial clades. some bacteria, such as |FRAME: TAX-562|, have three enzymes, each dedicated to one of the three hydroxylation events. In some organisms two hydroxylases catalyze the three reactions, yet in some organism a single enzyme, encoded by the ubiM gene, catalyzes all three reactions |CITS: [27822549]|. 

The enzymes of this pathway may form a membrane-associated complex |CITS: [393264]|. UbiX shows a genetic interaction with UbiG, suggesting a possible physical interaction within a complex |CITS: [16923914]|.

Phylloquinone (vitamin K1, 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) acts as the electron 
transfer cofactor A1 of photosystem I (PS I) in higher plants and cyanobacteria. In non-photosynthetic
microbes the very similar compound |FRAME: Menaquinones| plays an
essential role in several anaerobic electron transport systems |CITS: [8626063]|.
The chemical structure of menaquinone (vitamin K2)  exhibits a partly unsaturated side chain consisting
most often 7 prenyl units, whereas phylloquinone consists of a mostly saturated phytyl side chain of
4 units |CITS: [15686525]|.

The biosynthesis of phylloquinone was studied in detail in the cyanobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1148| and
the genes encoding enzymes of this pathway were identified by comparison with genes encoding
enzymes of the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway in |FRAME:TAX-562|
(see |FRAME:MENAQUINONESYN-PWY|) |CITS: [8626063]|. With the isolation and functional
confirmation of the homolog genes in |FRAME:TAX-1142| encoding for |FRAME: MONOMER-13822|,
|FRAME: MONOMER-13896| |CITS: [10722690]|, |FRAME: MONOMER-13821|
|CITS:[11772039]|, |FRAME: MONOMER-13897| and |FRAME: MONOMER-11678| |CITS: [JOHNSON03]|,
most of the enzymatic steps of the phylloquinone bisoynthesis have been determined and proven to be highly
identical with those in the menaquinone biosynthesis.

The biosynthesis of certain components of the multienzyme complex PS I (such as phylloquinone)
in cyanobacteria and plants have been found to follow analogous routes, including corresponding
enzymatic activities |CITS: [HEIDE82]| |CITS: [KOLKMANN87][SIMANTIRAS89][SIMANTIRAS91]|,
reflecting the phylogenetic origin of PS I in photosynthetic microbes.  

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The enzymatic steps involved in the biosynthesis of phylloquinone in cyanobacteria and plants are almost
identical to the biosynthetic route leading to the microbial complement menaquinone.
The discernible step between phylloquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis is the prenylation of
|FRAME: DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE| (DHNA).
The DHNA phytyltransferase catalyzes the attachment of a C-20 phytyl side chain leading to
|FRAME:CPD-6947| |CITS: [15686525]|, whereas microbial DHNA prenyltransferases attache a
multiprenyl side chain, forming  demethylmenaquinones. The length of the side chain varies among
different species.

It has been found that phylloquinone is not absolutely required for efficient electron transfer in PS I
|CITS: [10722690]|. At least in |FRAME: TAX-1148|, benzoquinones such as
|FRAME:PLASTOQUINONE-9|, which usually act as secondary electron acceptors in PS II
|CITS: [11470786][15681848]|, can efficiently replace phylloquinone in the A1-site of PS I as a
one-electron cofactor. However, as shown in both |FRAME:TAX-3701| and |FRAME: TAX-1148| mutants,
the deficiency of phylloquinone causes distortions in the thylakoid structure of chloroplasts,
decreases the content of PS I, and affects the functionality of PS II |CITS: [15686525]|.

It has been demonstrated that the final step of the pathway, a transmethylation reaction to form |FRAME:CPD-12831|, depends on the oxidation state of the penultimate substrate. This led to the discovery that one more reaction was inserted in between |FRAME:CPD-6947| and the final product |FRAME:CPD-12831|. This reaction was catalyzed by type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in both <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>  sp. PCC 6803 encoded by NDC1 and ndbB, respectively, which resulted in the formation of the reduced |FRAME:CPD-12830| |CITS:[26023160]|. Only this reduced (quinol) substrate was able to accept the electrons from the electrophilic |FRAME:S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| for the subsequent transmethylation step of the |FRAME:PWY-5027| to yield |FRAME:CPD-12831| |CITS:[26023160]|. In general, the intermediates of the |FRAME:PWY-5027| including in-feeding pathways such as |FRAME:PWY-5837| are depicted in their dihydroxy conformation, for example see |FRAME:DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE| and |FRAME:CPD-9925|, although the latter has been shown to be used <i>in vitro</i> in its diketo form |CITS:[19321747]|. However, the study on the dehydrogenases of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Synechocystis</i> provide evidence that |FRAME:CPD-6947| and probably any other preceding intermediates occur in their diketo instead of the dihydroxy form |CITS:[Basset15]|."

|FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE| is the universal precursor for the synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of |FRAME:CO-A| and |FRAME: ACP \"acyl carrier protein\"|. Only plants and microorganisms (including some eukaryotic microbes, such as |FRAME: TAX-4932|) can synthesize pantothenate <i>de novo</i> - animals require a dietary supplement. The enzymes of this pathway are therefore considered to be antimicrobial drug targets.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The starting compound for pantothenate biosynthesis, |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE|, is derived from the |FRAME: VALSYN-PWY| pathway. The first committed step in the pathway is the transfer of a methyl group to 2-keto-isovalerate by |FRAME: 3-METHYL-2-OXOBUT-OHCH3XFER-CPLX|. The product of this reaction, |FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE|, is subsequently reduced by |FRAME: 2-DEHYDROPANTOATE-REDUCT-MONOMER| to |FRAME: L-PANTOATE|. The final step is the ATP hydrolysis-dependent condensation of L-pantoate with |FRAME: B-ALANINE| to form |FRAME: PANTOTHENATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: PANTOATE-BETA-ALANINE-LIG-CPLX|.

The enzymes of this pathway are not essential for viability of |FRAME: TAX-83333| grown on media supplemented with pantothenate, due to the presence of a transporter for pantothenate, PanF |CITS: [2193919]|.

<b>This pathway in Yeast</b>

Three out of the four reactions involved in the conversion of |FRAME:2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| to the common intermediate towards |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis, i.e. |FRAME:4-P-PANTOTHENATE| have been associated with enzymes in |FRAME:TAX-4932|. The second reaction in the pathway catalyzed by the 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase in bacteria is still elusive for yeast and remains to be resolved. Utilizing genetic and biochemical approaches the functions of |FRAME:MONOMER3O-90| |CITS:[11154694] [16232925] [19266201]|, |FRAME:YIL145C-MONOMER| |CITS:[11154694] [19266201]| and |FRAME:MONOMER3O-268| |CITS:[19266201]| have been elucidated and emphasizes the general notion that the pathway sequences of |FRAME:4-P-PANTOTHENATE| and |FRAME:CO-A| biosynthesis are almost identical among the various kingdoms.  

<b>This Pathway in Plants</b>

Feeding studies in |FRAME:TAX-3888| leaf discs support the existence of a similar biosynthesis pathway of pantothenate via pantoate: when fed with [<sup>14</sup>C]valine, the radiolabel was incorporated into &alpha;-oxoisovalerate, oxopantoate and pantoate |CITS:[jones94]|.
A number of enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis have been characterized from different plants, including the enzyme catalyzing the last step of the pathway: pantothenate synthetase. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of pantothenate from pantoate and &beta;-alanine. The origin of plant &beta;-alanine is uncertain but appears to be different from that of bacteria which synthesize it from L-aspartate. Instead plants seem to produce &beta;-alanine from a variety of other sources, like polyamines, uracil and propionate (see |FRAME:PWY-3941|) |CITS: [RAMAN04]|."

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell. Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions. Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds are often depicted as NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively.

Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. In reactions where NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate. During the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> (or NADP<sup>+</sup>)  the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while the second proton is released into the medium. Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form:

NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2H -> NADH + H<sup>+</sup>

Additional roles for NAD in the cell have been suggested, including involvement in transcriptional regulation, longevity, and age-associated diseases. In yeast, it has been shown that NAD affects longevity and transcriptional silencing through the regulation of the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases |CITS: [12648681][14724176]|.

NAD is synthesised via two major pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the <i>de novo</i> pathway, and the salvage pathway. In the prokaryotic <i>de novo</i> pathway, the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| (this pathway), while in eukaryotes the <i>de novo</i> pathway starts with |FRAME: TRP| (|FRAME:NADSYN-PWY|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate <i>de novo</i> pathway, in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate |CITS: [11153263]|, while in eukaryotes, the <i>de novo</i> pathway starts with  tryptophan |CITS: [12062417]| (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).

The first attempt to elucidate a procaryotic pathway to NAD was reported by Ortega and Brown in 1960 |CITS: [13731310]|. They implicated (incorrectly) glycerol and a dicarboxylic acid as precursors in the synthesis of the pyridine ring of NAD in |FRAME:TAX-562|. Subsequent work by Chandler et al. |CITS: [4321550]| established that L-aspartate is the dicarboxylic acid precursor. Suzuki et al., in 1973, established that the three carbon precursor is dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and not glycerol |CITS: [4351074]|.
In addition, Andreoli et al demonstrated that quinolinate was a key intermediate in this pathway |CITS: [14013029]|. Eventually it became clear that quinolinate is indeed a precursor, not only in this pathway, but in all known NAD biosynthetic pathways.

<b>NAD biosynthesis In Plants</b>

In plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate. However, the finding of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway (|FRAME:NADSYN-PWY| in the genome sequence of rice (|FRAME:TAX-4530|) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to be further investigated |CITS: [16698895]| |CITS: [14977569]|. 

The genome of the dicotyledonous plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> contains homologs to all genes that encode enzymatic steps in the corresponding bacterial pathway (this pathway). Many of those homologous sequences are found in cDNA databases |CITS: [14593172]| which indicates their transcription and functional role as protein encoding genes. 

The first reaction is the conversion of L-aspartate to iminoaspartate catalyzed by the L-aspartate oxidase (AO). This enzyme has been partially purified from cotton |CITS: [6338879]|. The cDNA has also been isolated from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and its molecular function confirmed through functional complementation of L-aspartate oxidase deficient |FRAME:TAX-562| mutants (<i>nadB</i><sup>-</sup>) |CITS: [16698895]|. It should be pointed out that the catalyzed reaction differs from the enzyme of the same name, assigned to EC 1.4.3.16, which deaminates L-aspartate forming oxaloacetate and NH<sub>3</sub>.

Comparable to the L-aspartate oxidase of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the quinolinate synthase (QS) of this plant has been identified using a genomic approach. It could be demonstrated that the recombinant protein complemented quinolinate synthase deficient |FRAME:TAX-562| mutants (<i>nadA</i><sup>-</sup>) as well as the embryo-lethal phenotype of the homozygous allele in Arabidopsis |CITS: [16698895]|.

The third reaction in the early steps of NAD biosynthesis from L-aspartate is catalyzed by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRtase) which has been isolated and characterized from different plants |CITS: [4422841]| |CITS: [11198422]| |CITS: [16698895]|. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) the first intermediate that is also a component of the NAD recycling cycle |CITS: [Zheng04]| |CITS: [16714307]|.

The activity of the last two enzymes of the pathway, nicotinic-acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMN-AT) and NAD synthase (NAD-S) has been determined in tobacco |CITS: [WAGNER86]| |CITS: [WAGNER86A]|. For <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> those enzymes have been shown to exist as homologs in the genome, each of them encoded by a single gene |CITS: [HUNT04]| |CITS: [16698895]| |CITS: [14977569]| but their biochemical function remains to be confirmed."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Even though NAD molecules are not consumed during oxidation reactions, they have a relatively short half-life. For example, in |FRAME:TAX-562| the NAD<sup>+</sup> half-life is 90 minutes. Once enzymatically degraded, the pyrimidine moiety of the molecule can be recouped via the NAD salvage cycles. This pathway is used for two purposes: it recycles the internally degraded NAD products |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_NUCLEOTIDE| (also known as nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN) and |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE|, and it is used for the assimilation of exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup>.

Since the NAD<sup>+</sup> molecule is highly polar, it has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake. It does seem to be able to penetrate the external membrane, though, as the enzymes that break it down are found in the periplasm |CITS: [2841298]|. NAD<sup>+</sup> is first hydrolyzed by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.22|, into |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_NUCLEOTIDE| (NMN), which can be hydrolyzed further to |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| by |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.14|. Both enzymes are periplasmic. It should be noted that even though the activity of |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.14|. has been reported from a few organisms several decades ago |CITS: [4342726][457634]|, the identity of the enzyme has not been reported.

Both NMN and nicotinamide can be transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. Once there, |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| is converted via |FRAME: NIACINE| to |FRAME: NICOTINATE_NUCLEOTIDE|, at which point the pathway merges with the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway, and continues to NAD via |FRAME: DEAMIDO-NAD| (deamido-NAD).

There are several flavors of the salvage pathway found in different organisms, and even within the same organism. The one described above contains 6 reaction steps, and is often referred to as the PNC VI pathway, for Pyridine Nucleotide Cycling. However, there are also a four-step cycle (|FRAME: PWY-7761|) and a five-step cycle (|FRAME: PWY3O-4107|), termed PNC IV and V, respectively |CITS: [220211][6445894]|.

PNC IV is the major intracellular recycling pathway in |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [7021549]|, while PNC VI is the major cycle of |FRAME:TAX-90371| |CITS: [6445894]| and yeast |CITS:[12062417][11884393]|."

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADP) are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell.
Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.
Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these
compounds are often depicted as NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively.

Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms. In reactions where NAD or
NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate. During the reduction of 
NAD<sup>+</sup> (or NADP<sup>+</sup>)  the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while
the second proton is released into the medium. Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form:

NAD<sup>+</sup> + 2H -> NADH + H<sup>+</sup>

Additional roles for NAD in the cell have been suggested, including involvement in transcriptional regulation,
longevity, and age-associated diseases. In yeast, it has been shown that NAD affects longevity and
transcriptional silencing through the regulation of the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases
|CITS: [12648681][14724176]|.

NAD is synthesised via two major pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the <i>de novo</i> 
pathway, and the salvage pathway.
In the prokaryotic <i>de novo</i> pathway, the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate
(see |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|, while in eukaryotes the <i>de novo</i> pathway starts with  tryptophan
(|FRAME:NADSYN-PWY|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway is an NAD salvage pathway which proceeds via the intermediate |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE| (nicotinamide riboside, (<i>N</i>-ribosylnicotinamide, or NR). While the presence of this pathway has been suggested for several organisms, including |FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME: TAX-272131|, |FRAME:TAX-1358|, |FRAME:TAX-727|, |FRAME: TAX-730|, |FRAME: TAX-714|, and |FRAME:TAX-747| |CITS: [12446641]|, it is of particular importance to |FRAME:TAX-727| and other V-factor-dependent members of the |FRAME:TAX-745| family. These organisms lack the enzymes necessary for the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of NAD, as well as most of the enzymes for the more common NAD salvage pathway, and therefore require exogenous NAD supply in the form of one of the V-factor compounds, which include
NADP, NAD, NMN, and NR. However, only the non-phosphorylated V factor, NR, can be transported across the inner
membrane into the cytoplasm, where it can be converted to NAD and NADP |CITS: [12446641]|. Thus this pathway
is critical for these organisms |CITS: [1694467]|. For additional information about V-factor-dependent bacteria, look at the pathway |FRAME: NAD-BIOSYNTHESIS-III|.

Since NAD<sup>+</sup>, which is obtained from extracellular sources, is highly polar, it has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake. A key enzyme in this pathway is the periplasmic NadN protein, encoded by the <i>nadN</i> gene (<i>ushA</i> in |FRAME:TAX-562|). It has been shown that NadN has two activities: firstly, it hydrolyzes NAD<sup>+</sup> to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and secondly, it hydrolyzes NMN to nicotinamide riboside (NR) |CITS: [11395461]|. After NAD<sup>+</sup> is transported into the periplasmic space it is hydrolyzed into NMN and AMP by the NAD-nucleotidase activity of NadN. NMN is then hydrolyzed to NR and pyrophosphate, and the nicotinamide riboside thus formed is transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm, where it is it is converted back to NMN, and eventually, to NAD<sup>+</sup>.

The identity of the NR transporter has not been confirmed experimentally, but it is suggested that it is encoded by the <i>pnuC</i> gene, although earlier work with the PnuC protein of |FRAME:TAX-28901| serovar Typhimurium suggested that it encodes the transport of NMN |CITS: [6216244][11395461]|.

NADP<sup>+</sup> is recycled in the same manner, following dephosphorylation to NAD<sup>+</sup>. In |FRAME: TAX-727|, this dephosphorylation is performed by the outer membrane glycoprotein <i>e</i> (P4), encoded by the <i>hel</i> gene.

While the pathway is predicted to be present in |FRAME:TAX-543|, it probably serves a minor role compared to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis and the main NAD salvage cycle (|FRAME: PYRIDNUCSAL-PWY|). Some of the enzymatic activities associated with this pathway have been described in |FRAME:TAX-543| as early as 1951 |CITS: [14907738]|, but it was only recently that the genes responsible for them were identified. Surprisingly, several activities were found to be functions of the multifunctional protein NadR, which was initially believed to have a role in regulation only |CITS: [10464228][12446641]|."

Menaquinones (MK) and demethylmenaquinones (DMK) are low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane, found in many bacterial species.  These quinones function as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.
Menaquinones have also been implicated in regulation, as they are necessary for sporulation and proper regulation of cytochrome formation in some Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [4353869][4202999]|.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone and/or demethylmenaquinones as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, contain ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|. The main difference between
these quinone molecules is their redox potential. For example, the redox potential for ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone has been measured as +112 mv, +36 mv, and -74 mv, respectively, in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-729| |CITS: [187454]|.

Menaquinones are considered a vitamin (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), since they are essential for animals, mostly for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Animals can not synthesize menaquinones, but usually receive a sufficient amount from bacteria growing in their intestines. In the absence of menaquinone or the related compound |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) which is synthesized in plants, animals suffer from hemorrhage |CITS: [Dam35]|. Menaquinone was first isolated from putrefied fish meal by McKee in 1939 |CITS: [17783315]|, and its structure resolved in 1958 |CITS: [Isler58]|.

The biosynthesis of menaquinones is essentially identical to that of demethylmenaquinones, with one additional step, comprising the addition of a methyl group to the naphthoquinone ring. Many bacterial species do not have this methylase and produce demethylmenaquinone as their sole quinone |CITS: [7022156]|.

All three quinones are synthesized from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, an intermediate of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. However, the pathways of (demethyl)menaquinone synthesis diverts from that for ubiquinones early on.
Most organisms synthesize their menaquinones via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|, although some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-1902| and |FRAME: TAX-274|, synthesize menaquinones in alternative pathways, via |FRAME: CPD-10477| or |FRAME: CPD-13324| |CITS: [18801996][21489995][23972005]|.

Menaquinones are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism. The most common menaquinones contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units. However, menaquinones containing 4 |CITS:[413478][6048777]|, 5 |CITS: [6048777][5005959]|, 6 |CITS: [5005959][6102980][5418698][5412037]|, 10 |CITS: [6102980][7462123]|, 11 |CITS: [6102980] [7462123]|, 12 |CITS: [6102980]|, and 13 |CITS: [6102980]| isoprene units have been reported in bacteria.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

A few bacterial phyla appear to possess menaquinones with very long prenyl side chains. Several members of the |FRAME: TAX-976| phylum, which consists of obligate anaerobes, were reported to produce |FRAME: CPD-9723| as either their main quinone (as in the case of |FRAME: TAX-28131| |CITS: [6102980][6363375]|), in combination with |FRAME: CPD-9719|, as reported for |FRAME: TAX-28111| |CITS: [6363375]|, |FRAME: TAX-817| |CITS: [6363375][7118751][7462123]|, |FRAME: TAX-28132| |CITS: [6102980][6363375]|, |FRAME: TAX-28116| |CITS: [6363375]|, |FRAME: TAX-28134| strains 5540, G9a-C2 and 7880, |FRAME: TAX-818|, and |FRAME: TAX-821| |CITS: [6102980][6363375]|, or in combination with |FRAME: CPD-9722|, as in |FRAME: TAX-28134| strains 1210 and 1221and |FRAME: TAX-839| |CITS: [6102980][6363375]|.

Menaquinones (MK) and demethylmenaquinones (DMK) are low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane, found in many bacterial species.  These quinones function as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.
Menaquinones have also been implicated in regulation, as they are necessary for sporulation and proper regulation of cytochrome formation in some Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [4353869][4202999]|.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone and/or demethylmenaquinones as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, contain ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|. The main difference between
these quinone molecules is their redox potential. For example, the redox potential for ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone has been measured as +112 mv, +36 mv, and -74 mv, respectively, in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-729| |CITS: [187454]|.

Menaquinones are considered a vitamin (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), since they are essential for animals, mostly for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Animals can not synthesize menaquinones, but usually receive a sufficient amount from bacteria growing in their intestines. In the absence of menaquinone or the related compound |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) which is synthesized in plants, animals suffer from hemorrhage |CITS: [Dam35]|. Menaquinone was first isolated from putrefied fish meal by McKee in 1939 |CITS: [17783315]|, and its structure resolved in 1958 |CITS: [Isler58]|.

The biosynthesis of menaquinones is essentially identical to that of demethylmenaquinones, with one additional step, comprising the addition of a methyl group to the naphthoquinone ring. Many bacterial species do not have this methylase and produce demethylmenaquinone as their sole quinone |CITS: [7022156]|.

All three quinones are synthesized from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, an intermediate of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. However, the pathways of (demethyl)menaquinone synthesis diverts from that for ubiquinones early on.
Most organisms synthesize their menaquinones via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|, although some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-1902| and |FRAME: TAX-274|, synthesize menaquinones in alternative pathways, via |FRAME: CPD-10477| or |FRAME: CPD-13324| |CITS: [18801996][21489995][23972005]|.

Menaquinones are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism. The most common menaquinones contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units. However, menaquinones containing 4 |CITS:[413478][6048777]|, 5 |CITS: [6048777][5005959]|, 6 |CITS: [5005959][6102980][5418698][5412037]|, 10 |CITS: [6102980][7462123]|, 11 |CITS: [6102980] [7462123]|, 12 |CITS: [6102980]|, and 13 |CITS: [6102980]| isoprene units have been reported in bacteria.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

A few bacterial phyla appear to possess menaquinones with very long prenyl side chains. Several members of the |FRAME: TAX-838| genus, which consists of obligate anaerobes, were reported to produce |FRAME: CPD-9722|. This quinone was found in combination with either |FRAME: CPD-9723|, as reported for |FRAME: TAX-28134| strains 1210 and 1221, |FRAME: TAX-83231| strains B5 and 118B, and |FRAME:TAX-839| strain R2, or |FRAME:CPD-9721|, as in |FRAME:TAX-28134| strains VP1 8906D and HS4 and |FRAME: TAX-83231| strains NP333, 75J1, J1 and WP H61
|CITS: [6102980][6363375]|.

In addition, several species that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-201174| phylum, and especially to the |FRAME: TAX-33882| genus, were reported to contain |FRAME: CPD-9722|. These organisms, which contain |FRAME: CPD-9722| along with |FRAME: CPD-9723|, include: |FRAME: TAX-33884|, |FRAME: TAX-33917|, |FRAME: TAX-41986|, |FRAME: TAX-33885|,
|FRAME: TAX-33918| |CITS:[7462123][7022156]|, |FRAME: TAX-69368| and |FRAME: TAX-2033| |CITS: [6775048]|."

Menaquinones (MK) and demethylmenaquinones (DMK) are low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane, found in many bacterial species.  These quinones function as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.
Menaquinones have also been implicated in regulation, as they are necessary for sporulation and proper regulation of cytochrome formation in some Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [4353869][4202999]|.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone and/or demethylmenaquinones as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, contain ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|. The main difference between
these quinone molecules is their redox potential. For example, the redox potential for ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone has been measured as +112 mv, +36 mv, and -74 mv, respectively, in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-729| |CITS: [187454]|.

Menaquinones are considered a vitamin (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), since they are essential for animals, mostly for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Animals can not synthesize menaquinones, but usually receive a sufficient amount from bacteria growing in their intestines. In the absence of menaquinone or the related compound |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) which is synthesized in plants, animals suffer from hemorrhage |CITS: [Dam35]|. Menaquinone was first isolated from putrefied fish meal by McKee in 1939 |CITS: [17783315]|, and its structure resolved in 1958 |CITS: [Isler58]|.

The biosynthesis of menaquinones is essentially identical to that of demethylmenaquinones, with one additional step, comprising the addition of a methyl group to the naphthoquinone ring. Many bacterial species do not have this methylase and produce demethylmenaquinone as their sole quinone |CITS: [7022156]|.

All three quinones are synthesized from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, an intermediate of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. However, the pathways of (demethyl)menaquinone synthesis diverts from that for ubiquinones early on.
Most organisms synthesize their menaquinones via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|, although some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-1902| and |FRAME: TAX-274|, synthesize menaquinones in alternative pathways, via |FRAME: CPD-10477| or |FRAME: CPD-13324| |CITS: [18801996][21489995][23972005]|.

Menaquinones are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism. The most common menaquinones contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units. However, menaquinones containing 4 |CITS:[413478][6048777]|, 5 |CITS: [6048777][5005959]|, 6 |CITS: [5005959][6102980][5418698][5412037]|, 10 |CITS: [6102980][7462123]|, 11 |CITS: [6102980] [7462123]|, 12 |CITS: [6102980]|, and 13 |CITS: [6102980]| isoprene units have been reported in bacteria.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

|FRAME: CPD-9718| (MK-7) is by far the most common quinone in Gram-positive bacteria. It has been shown to be the major form of quinone in dozens of species, including many |FRAME: TAX-1386| species, as well as |FRAME: TAX-1562|, |FRAME: TAX-2755|, |FRAME: TAX-1637|, and |FRAME: TAX-1279| (see |CITS: [7022156]| for an exhaustive list).
The best studied menaquinone biosynthetic pathway outside of |FRAME: TAX-83333| (which makes |FRAME: CPD-9728|) is that of |FRAME: TAX-1423|, which makes MK-7 |CITS: [6780515][3131309] [1629163][8169214][8566759][10194342]|.

Even though MK-7 is most prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, it has been documented in other organisms as well. It has been shown to be the major quinone in several members of the |FRAME: TAX-68336|, including |FRAME: TAX-115852| (along with |FRAME: CPD-9611|) |CITS: [5782248]|, |FRAME: TAX-997| |CITS: [4216336]|, and |FRAME: TAX-28132| |CITS: [5411759]|.

MK-7 also occurs as a minor quinone in several Gram-negative species, including |FRAME: TAX-51367| (which belongs to the |FRAME: TAX-1236|) |CITS: [Collins81]|, |FRAME: TAX-33| (which belongs to the |FRAME: TAX-28221|) |CITS: [5782248]|, and |FRAME: TAX-274| and |FRAME: TAX-271|, which belong to the |FRAME: TAX-1297| phylum |CITS: [7462123][7022156]|.

In Green sulfur bacteria MK-7 is present in their photosystem I-type reaction centers |CITS: [11687219]|.

In addition, MK-7 was found to be the major quinone of the archaebacterium |FRAME: TAX-2303|

Menaquinones (MK) and demethylmenaquinones (DMK) are low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane, found in many bacterial species.  These quinones function as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.
Menaquinones have also been implicated in regulation, as they are necessary for sporulation and proper regulation of cytochrome formation in some Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [4353869][4202999]|.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone and/or demethylmenaquinones as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, contain ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|. The main difference between
these quinone molecules is their redox potential. For example, the redox potential for ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone has been measured as +112 mv, +36 mv, and -74 mv, respectively, in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-729| |CITS: [187454]|.

Menaquinones are considered a vitamin (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), since they are essential for animals, mostly for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Animals can not synthesize menaquinones, but usually receive a sufficient amount from bacteria growing in their intestines. In the absence of menaquinone or the related compound |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) which is synthesized in plants, animals suffer from hemorrhage |CITS: [Dam35]|. Menaquinone was first isolated from putrefied fish meal by McKee in 1939 |CITS: [17783315]|, and its structure resolved in 1958 |CITS: [Isler58]|.

The biosynthesis of menaquinones is essentially identical to that of demethylmenaquinones, with one additional step, comprising the addition of a methyl group to the naphthoquinone ring. Many bacterial species do not have this methylase and produce demethylmenaquinone as their sole quinone |CITS: [7022156]|.

All three quinones are synthesized from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, an intermediate of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. However, the pathways of (demethyl)menaquinone synthesis diverts from that for ubiquinones early on.
Most organisms synthesize their menaquinones via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|, although some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-1902| and |FRAME: TAX-274|, synthesize menaquinones in alternative pathways, via |FRAME: CPD-10477| or |FRAME: CPD-13324| |CITS: [18801996][21489995][23972005]|.

Menaquinones are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism. The most common menaquinones contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units. However, menaquinones containing 4 |CITS:[413478][6048777]|, 5 |CITS: [6048777][5005959]|, 6 |CITS: [5005959][6102980][5418698][5412037]|, 10 |CITS: [6102980][7462123]|, 11 |CITS: [6102980] [7462123]|, 12 |CITS: [6102980]|, and 13 |CITS: [6102980]| isoprene units have been reported in bacteria.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The best characterized menaquinone biosynthetic pathway is that of |FRAME: TAX-83333| that synthesizes |FRAME: CPD-9728| (MK-8). MK-8 is not unique to E. coli, and is found in many different bacterial species.

A study of the quinones of halophilic archaebacteria found that MK-8 was the major quinone in most species included in the study, including |FRAME: TAX-2246|, |FRAME: TAX-2250|, |FRAME: TAX-2242|, |FRAME: TAX-2248| and |FRAME: TAX-29284| |CITS: [5049648][4822788][Collins81]|.

MK-8 is very common in facultatively anaerobic Gram negative bacteria, such as the enterobacteria. In addition to |FRAME: TAX-83333| it has been documented in |FRAME: TAX-546|, |FRAME: TAX-548|, |FRAME: TAX-554|, |FRAME: TAX-584|, |FRAME: TAX-585| |CITS: [4886765]| and |FRAME: TAX-615| |CITS: [Bezborodov69]|, as well as the non-eneterobacteria |FRAME: TAX-644|, |FRAME: TAX-648| |CITS: [4886765]| and |FRAME: TAX-51367| |CITS: [Collins81]|.
MK-8 has not been discovered in obligate anaerobes so far.

Some aerobic Gram-negative bacteria that contain MK-8 as their major quinone include the gliding bacterium |FRAME: TAX-33| |CITS: [4216336]|, and several members of the |FRAME: TAX-1297| phylum, including |FRAME: TAX-271| and |FRAME: TAX-274| |CITS: [7462123][7022156]|, |FRAME: TAX-32062|  and |FRAME: TAX-1299| |CITS: [Yamada77]|.

Even though most Gram-positive bacteria contain |FRAME: CPD-9718| as their major quinone, a few are known to make MK-8 instead, including |FRAME: TAX-1473| |CITS: [119033]|, |FRAME: TAX-1428| |CITS: [119033]|, |FRAME: TAX-1618| |CITS: [7462123]|, |FRAME: TAX-37922| |CITS: [Collins81]|, certain |FRAME:TAX-1270| strains |CITS:[Watanuki72][Yamada76]|, and |FRAME:TAX-1373| |CITS:[Yamada76]|.

MK-8 was also found as a minor component in the phototrophic bacteria |FRAME: TAX-1049| |CITS: [14240125]|, |FRAME: TAX-28068| and Rhodospirillum sp. 2761 |CITS: [5727384]|."

Menaquinones (MK) and demethylmenaquinones (DMK) are low-molecular weight lipophilic components of the cytoplasmic membrane, found in many bacterial species.  These quinones function as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.
Menaquinones have also been implicated in regulation, as they are necessary for sporulation and proper regulation of cytochrome formation in some Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [4353869][4202999]|.

Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone and/or demethylmenaquinones as the main quinone. However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain menaquinone or demethylmenaquinone as their main quinones. Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-562|, contain ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|. The main difference between
these quinone molecules is their redox potential. For example, the redox potential for ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone has been measured as +112 mv, +36 mv, and -74 mv, respectively, in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-729| |CITS: [187454]|.

Menaquinones are considered a vitamin (vitamin K<sub>2</sub>), since they are essential for animals, mostly for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Animals can not synthesize menaquinones, but usually receive a sufficient amount from bacteria growing in their intestines. In the absence of menaquinone or the related compound |FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| (vitamin K<sub>1</sub>) which is synthesized in plants, animals suffer from hemorrhage |CITS: [Dam35]|. Menaquinone was first isolated from putrefied fish meal by McKee in 1939 |CITS: [17783315]|, and its structure resolved in 1958 |CITS: [Isler58]|.

The biosynthesis of menaquinones is essentially identical to that of demethylmenaquinones, with one additional step, comprising the addition of a methyl group to the naphthoquinone ring. Many bacterial species do not have this methylase and produce demethylmenaquinone as their sole quinone |CITS: [7022156]|.

All three quinones are synthesized from |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, an intermediate of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. However, the pathways of (demethyl)menaquinone synthesis diverts from that for ubiquinones early on.
Most organisms synthesize their menaquinones via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE|, although some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-1902| and |FRAME: TAX-274|, synthesize menaquinones in alternative pathways, via |FRAME: CPD-10477| or |FRAME: CPD-13324| |CITS: [18801996][21489995][23972005]|.

Menaquinones are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism. The most common menaquinones contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units. However, menaquinones containing 4 |CITS:[413478][6048777]|, 5 |CITS: [6048777][5005959]|, 6 |CITS: [5005959][6102980][5418698][5412037]|, 10 |CITS: [6102980][7462123]|, 11 |CITS: [6102980] [7462123]|, 12 |CITS: [6102980]|, and 13 |CITS: [6102980]| isoprene units have been reported in bacteria.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

A few bacterial phyla appear to possess menaquinones with very long prenyl side chains. Several oral strains of the |FRAME: TAX-838| genus, which consists of obligate anaerobes, were reported to produce |FRAME: CPD-9721|. This quinone was found in combination with |FRAME: CPD-9722| in |FRAME:TAX-28134| strains VP1 8906D and HS4 and in |FRAME: TAX-83231| strains NP333, 75J1, J1 and WP H61 |CITS: [6102980][6363375]|.

In addition, several species that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-33882| genus were reported to contain |FRAME: CPD-9721| as a minor component. These organisms, which contain |FRAME: CPD-9723| and |FRAME: CPD-9722| as their major quinones, include |FRAME: TAX-33885|, |FRAME: TAX-33918| |CITS:[7462123][7022156]|, |FRAME: TAX-69368| and |FRAME: TAX-2033| |CITS: [6775048]|."

Folates are tripartite molecules comprising pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pABA), and glutamate moieties. In natural folates the pterin ring exists in the dihydro or tetrahydro state. Folate usually has a gamma-linked polyglutamyl tail of up to eight residues attached to the first glutamate. The one-carbon units (methyl or formyl) are either attached to the N-5 of the pterin moiety, to the N-10 of the pABA moiety or bridged in between these two (e.g., 5,10-methenyl or methylene-THF). 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolates are involved in tetrahydrofolate, purine and formate synthesis |CITS: [7868604] [17645794]|. 

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The formation of the formyl and methyl derivatives of tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) directly involved in or representing sidesteps of the biosynthesis of this vital cofactor is displayed in this pathway. Conversion of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate occurs either directly through hydrolysis or via 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate in several steps |CITS: [7868604] [17645794]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=FOLSYN-PWY"	"superpathway of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis and salvage"	"FOLSYN-PWY"	"<b>General Background</b>

Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism 
|CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|.

Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons) of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.

Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084][SCOTT00][KIRK94]|. In addition, in eukaryotic cells the glutamylated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|.

The product of this pathway, |FRAME: THF| (tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate, H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>,
THF), is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state
of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions (see |FRAME: PWY-2201|), and the number of conjugated glutamate residues  (see |FRAME: PWY-2161|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of folates is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants.

Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of a pterin, |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE| and |FRAME:GLT| moieties.
The first two are synthesized from |FRAME:GTP| and |FRAME:CHORISMATE|, respectively.
The first committed step catalyzed by |FRAME: FOLE-CPLX| converts GTP into |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3|.
The triphosphate motif is removed by a still unknown process, and the resulting
|FRAME: DIHYDRO-NEO-PTERIN| is converted to |FRAME: AMINO-OH-HYDROXYMETHYL-DIHYDROPTERIDINE|
by |FRAME: CPLX0-3936| (FolB).
The consecutive action of the FolK, FolP, FolC, and FolA enzymes finally produces the final product, |FRAME: THF| |CITS: [12039964]|.

In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pABA (synthesized in plastids) in mitochondria followed by subsequent glutamylation and reduction steps which may take place in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743][11752472]|. The recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each of them encoded by a different gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least parts of the pathway can be carried out independently in those compartments.

In addition to the <i>de novo</i> pathway, many organisms also possess a salvage pathway that is used to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from breakdown products of folates in the cell, such as 5 or 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.

<b>About Folates In Animals</b>

While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the <i>de novo</i> synthesis pathway, vertebrates are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as  |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N \"<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydrofolate\"| and |FRAME:FORMYL-THF-GLU-N \"<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate\"| (formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|.

Polyglutamyl folates are hydrolyzed to folylmonoglutamates by |FRAME: HS06361-MONOMER|, and metabolized within the enterocyte into 5-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin |CITS: [13906633][2736319]|, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent |FRAME:ENZRXN-5465| to monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>).

Insufficient supply of the vitamin in vertebrates leads to anemia in adults, and has been shown to cause neural tube malformation in human embryos |CITS: [11744531]|. In addition, folate defficiency has been linked to a number of other birth defects, several types of cancer, dementia, affective disorders, Down's syndrom, and serious conditions affecting pregnancy outcome (for a review, see |CITS: [11001804]|)."

Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis.
Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|.

Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons) of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.

Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084][SCOTT00][KIRK94]|. In addition, in eukaryotic cells the glutamylated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|.

The product of this pathway, |FRAME: THF| (tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate, H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>,
THF), is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state
of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions (see
|FRAME: PWY-2201|), and the number of conjugated glutamate residues  (see |FRAME: PWY-2161|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of folates is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants.

Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of a pterin, |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE| and |FRAME:GLT| moieties.
The first two are synthesized from |FRAME:GTP| and |FRAME:CHORISMATE|, respectively.
The first committed step catalyzed by |FRAME: FOLE-CPLX| converts GTP into |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3|.
The triphosphate motif is removed by a still unknown process, and the resulting
|FRAME: DIHYDRO-NEO-PTERIN| is converted to |FRAME: AMINO-OH-HYDROXYMETHYL-DIHYDROPTERIDINE|
by |FRAME: CPLX0-3936| (FolB). The consecutive action of the FolK, FolP, FolC, and FolA enzymes finally produces the final product, |FRAME: THF| |CITS: [12039964]|.

In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pABA (synthesized in plastids) in mitochondria followed by subsequent glutamylation and reduction steps which may take place in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743][11752472]|.
The recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each
of them encoded by a different gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least
parts of the pathway can be carried out independently in those compartments.

In addition to the <i>de novo</i> pathway, many organisms also possess a salvage pathway that is used
to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from breakdown products of folates in the cell, such as 5 or 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.

<b>About Folates In Animals</b>

While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the <i>de novo</i> synthesis pathway, vertebrates are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin.
Food folates exist mainly as |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N \"<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydrofolate\"| (<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) and |FRAME: FORMYL-THF-GLU-N \"<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate\"| (<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|.

Polyglutamyl folates are hydrolyzed to folylmonoglutamates by |FRAME: HS06361-MONOMER|, and metabolized within the enterocyte into 5-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin |CITS: [13906633][2736319]|, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent |FRAME:ENZRXN-5465| to monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>).

Insufficient supply of the vitamin in vertebrates leads to anemia in adults, and has been shown to cause neural tube malformation in human embryos |CITS: [11744531]|. In addition, folate defficiency has been linked to a number of other birth defects, several types of cancer, dementia, affective disorders, Down's syndrom, and serious conditions affecting pregnancy outcome (for a review, see |CITS: [11001804]|)."

Riboflavin is also known as vitamin B2, because it is an essential nutrient and can not be synthesized by mammals.

The biosynthesis of one riboflavin molecule requires one molecule of |FRAME: GTP| and two molecules of
|FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| as substrates.
The imidazole ring of GTP is hydrolytically opened, yielding a 4, 5-diaminopyrimidine which is converted to
|FRAME: AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE| by a sequence of deamination, side chain reduction
and dephosphorylation. Condensation of |FRAME: AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE| with
|FRAME: DIHYDROXY-BUTANONE-P| obtained from |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| results in the formation of
|FRAME: DIMETHYL-D-RIBITYL-LUMAZINE|.
Dismutation of the lumazine derivative yields |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN| and
|FRAME: AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE|, which is recycled in the pathway |CITS: [10940330]|.

The riboflavin biosynthesis pathway and its enzymes are well understood, although the enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation of |FRAME: CPD-1086| has been identified only recently |CITS: [24123841]|. 

Several bifunctional enzymes are involved in this pathway in |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-1423|.
One bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the two steps required for converting |FRAME: DIAMINO-OH-PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINO-PYR| to |FRAME: CPD-1086|. Another such enzyme catalyzes the last two steps of the pathway, |FRAME:ENZRXN-16078| and |FRAME:ENZRXN-16079|.

In addition, in both |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-1423| |FRAME: CPLX-7778| is a bifunctional enzyme complex
that catalyzes the two steps leading from |FRAME:AMINO-RIBOSYLAMINO-1H-3H-PYR-DIONE| and
|FRAME:DIHYDROXY-BUTANONE-P| to |FRAME:RIBOFLAVIN| via |FRAME:DIMETHYL-D-RIBITYL-LUMAZINE|.
This complex consists of a core of three &alpha; subunits and 60 &beta; subunits arranged in an icosahedral
capsid around the &alpha; trimer in the central core |CITS: [7473709]|.

Different variations of the pathway are found in the different kingdoms of life.
The enzymes catalyzing the fungal pathway are similar to the bacterial/plant ones, but there is a difference in the order in which they act. Two enzymatic steps are required to convert |FRAME: DIAMINO-OH-PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINO-PYR| to |FRAME: CPD-1086| - a demaination and a reduction.
In bacteria and plants, the deaminase acts first, followed by the reductase (although both steps are catalyzed by a single
bifunctional enzyme in some organisms) |CITS: [15208317]|, while in fungi the reductase acts first, followed by the deaminase (see |FRAME: PWY-6168|). The archaeal pathway also differs in several steps (see |FRAME: PWY-6167|)."

|FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|. 

Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years. The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [20693992]|.

Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, are responsible for the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562|. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.

The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in |FRAME: TAX-562| are known from <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis of products labeled <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|. The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate. The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|. This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|. As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.

The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicate in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.
Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [Indrajit94][13930373]|. An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]|. Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 \"BioC\"| converts the free carboxyl group of a |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| thioester to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|.The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: CPD-12454| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.

Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters \"pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester\"|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 \"BioH\"| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs \"pimeloyl-[acp]\"|. The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 \"BioF\"|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly.

It should be noted that many organisms that have a |FRAME: EG10119| gene do not have a homolog of the |FRAME: EG10122| gene. A remarkable diversity was found in the enzymes catalyzing this step, with different, non-related genes found in different organisms, including |FRAME: G-17965| from |FRAME: TAX-401614| |CITS: [23152908]|, |FRAME: G-15494| from |FRAME: TAX-93059| |CITS: [23152908]|, |FRAME: G-15495| from |FRAME: TAX-71421| |CITS: [24313380]|, and |FRAME: HP0287| from |FRAME: TAX-210| |CITS: [26868423]|.

The next step in the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: EG10117|-encoded |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|. This product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, the |FRAME: EG10120|-encoded |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|. This enzye catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.

The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10118|.
This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.  It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme <i>in vitro</i>, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the
source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|. However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.

According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway. When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.

An <i>in vitro</i> system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|."

By definition, the lower ligand base of cobalamin-type B12 vitamins is |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE|.

In this pathway |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| is tethered to the corrin ring via a structure known as the nucleotide loop, which is composed from |FRAME:R-1-AMINOPROPAN-2-YL-PHOSPHATE| and |FRAME:DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE|.

Until 2007 it was believed that the last reaction in the biosynthesis of |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN| was the linking of |FRAME:ALPHA-RIBAZOLE| (a product of |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE|) to |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE-GDP|, in a reaction catalyzed by cobalamine synthase. However, it has been shown that at least in |FRAME: TAX-90371| the true substrate for the enzyme is |FRAME:ALPHA-RIBAZOLE-5-P|, and not |FRAME:ALPHA-RIBAZOLE| |CITS: [17209023]|, and that the product of the reaction is actually |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN-5-P|. Thus, there is one more reaction in the pathway, the dephosphorylation of |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN-5-P| to |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME:MONOMER-13213|, the enzyme initially proposed to catalyze the dephosphorylation of |FRAME: ALPHA-RIBAZOLE-5-P| |CITS: [17209023]|.

This model addresses several questions that were associated with the previous model, such as the presence of |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN-5-P| (which has been documented much earlier in the organism |FRAME: TAX-1752| |CITS: [4296474]|), the higher affinity of the CobS protein (and its homologs in other organisms) towards |FRAME:ALPHA-RIBAZOLE-5-P|, and the inability of |FRAME:G-10054| mutants to salvage cobyrate under aerobic conditions |CITS: [17209023]|.

Many bacterial species do not have the full genetic information required for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, but can synthesize cobalamin when supplied with |FRAME: COBINAMIDE|, a stable cobamide that is not a true intermediate of the <i>de novo</i> pathway |CITS: [14351147][8770581]|.

In order to process |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| to |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, it has to be converted into a real intermediate of the pathway. In most bacteria this is done by the attachment of the upper ligand 5'-deoxyadenosine to yield |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE|, followed by phosphorylation to yield |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE-P|, an intermediate of the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway (this pathway).

Archaebacteria as well as many bacterial species utilze a different salvage pathway, where |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE| is first converted to |FRAME: CPD-691| (see |FRAME: PWY-6269|).

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-6269"	"superpathway of adenosylcobalamin salvage from cobinamide II"	"PWY-6269"	"<i>De novo</i> synthesis of cobamides requires a great deal of genetic information, which is only found in some prokaryotes.
Many bacterial species do not have the full genetic information required for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, but can synthesize cobalamin when supplied with |FRAME: COBINAMIDE|, a stable cobamide that is not a true intermediate of the <i>de novo</i> pathway |CITS: [14351147][8770581]|.

In order to process |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| to |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, it has to be converted into a real intermediate of the pathway. In most bacteria this is done by the attachment of the upper ligand 5'-deoxyadenosine to yield |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE|, followed by phosphorylation to yield |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE-P|, an intermediate of the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway (see |FRAME: COBALSYN-PWY|).

Archaebacteria utilze a different salvage pathway, where |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE| is first converted to |FRAME: CPD-691| by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.90| (CbiZ). |FRAME: CPD-691 \" Adenosylcobyrate\"| is then converted to |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBINAMIDE-P| by the action of |FRAME: EC-6.3.1.10| (CbiB) |CITS: [14990804]|.

Archaea possess several enzymes that are non-orthologous replacements for the bacterial genes. For example, the archaeal |FRAME: G-11341| catalyzes the same reaction as the bacterial |FRAME: G-10054| |CITS: [16547066]|, and the archaeal |FRAME: G-11343| replaces the bacterial |FRAME: G-502| and |FRAME: G-10056| |CITS: [12486068]|.
Some archaea carry the |FRAME: G-11342| gene, which encodes a fusion of the genes |FRAME: G-11339| and |FRAME: G-11341| |CITS: [16740929]|.

There are many bacterial species that carry the genes of the archaeal salvage pathway. It is believed that the origin of the genes is archaeal, and that the bacterial genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer |CITS: [18808385]|

The complete, oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle plays a central role in the energy metabolism of
aerobic organisms.  In most autotrophic bacteria and anaerobic archaea, the TCA cycle operates in a
reductive, biosynthetic direction  (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: TCA| and |FRAME: P23-PWY|).
Some anaerobic archaea such as |FRAME: TAX-2271|, contain an oxidative TCA cycle that uses
elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as terminal electron acceptor |CITS: [Selig94]| and reviewed in
|CITS: [9084754]|.  Incomplete oxidative or reductive TCA cycles have also been identified in some
organisms, including obligate autotrophs and methanotrophs.  Although the gene encolding
&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is absent, or not expressed, these incomplete cycles can still
convert pyruvate to necessary biosynthetic intermediates in response to anaerobic, or microaerophilic
growth conditions (reviewed in |CITS: [15449607]|).

Methanogens (anaerobic archaea) lack the ability to perform a complete oxidative or reductive TCA cycle,
and biosynthetic intermediates are proposed to be synthesized by incomplete cycles (in
|CITS: [15595725]|).  Most methanogens use the incomplete reductive TCA cycle for biosynthesis of
intermediates (in |CITS: [3922956]|).  An incomplete reductive TCA cycle has been shown in the
methanogen |FRAME: TAX-2203| using <sup>13</sup>C labeling and NMR, although no
enzyme assays were provided |CITS: [6619097]|.  It has also been shown in |FRAME: TAX-145262| by
radiolabeled succinate incorporation studies |CITS: [29586]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Enzymes of an incomplete reductive TCA cycle have been experimentally demonstrated in the
autotrophic methanogen |FRAME: TAX-39152| |CITS: [3667534]| and the pathway is shown here.
Acetyl-CoA entering this pathway may be biosynthesized by the acetyl-CoA pathway of autotrophic
carbon dioxide fixation (see |FRAME: CODH-PWY|) |CITS: [11607093] [3133359]|, or it may be
biosynthesized from acetate when this facultative autotroph is grown on acetate (see
|FRAME: PWY0-1313|) |CITS: [3667534]|. Acetyl-CoA is converted to pyruvate by |FRAME: CPLX-7031|,
and pyruvate is converted to the necessary biosynthetic intermediates |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|,
|FRAME: SUC-COA|, and |FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE|. The later is a precursor of |FRAME:GLT|,
as indicated by the pathway link.

The acetogenic methanogens |FRAME: TAX-2208| and |FRAME: TAX-2223| have
been shown to contain incomplete oxidative TCA cycles involved in acetate assimilation
(in |CITS: [762016] [3840474] [3922956]|).  Evidence for an incomplete oxidative TCA cycle for amino
acid biosynthesis in the cold-adapted (psychrophilic) archaeon |FRAME: TAX-29291| has
been obtained by proteomic analysis, but no enzyme activity assays were provided |CITS: [15595725]|.  

It should be noted, however, that if current genome-based predictions are verified experimentally,
some organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-145262|, with incomplete TCA
cycles might eventually be shown to contain complete cycles.  In these cases, other gene products
would provide the missing enzyme activity (|CITS: [14568143]|, and reviewed in |CITS: [10390638]|)."

The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmospheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria.
This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as \"basal structure\", \"mucopeptide\", \"glycopeptide\", \"glycosaminopeptide\" and \"murein\"). Peptidoglycan is found on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane of almost all eubacteria, and is unique to these organisms.

Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.
The glycan moiety of the peptidoglycan is remarkably uniform among all bacteria, and is made up of alternating &beta;-1,4-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and <i>N</i>-acetyl muramate residues, with an average chain length (in different organisms) of 10 to 65 disaccharide units (although it is about 5000 in |FRAME: TAX-1423|). The peptide moiety is less uniform, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5265|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway describes the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan found in most Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some Gram-positive bacteria. The pathway starts at the cytoplasm, where in six steps the peptidoglycan precursor |FRAME:UDP-NAcMur-Peptides| is synthesized. This precursor is then attached to the memberane acceptor |FRAME:UNDECAPRENYL-P|, generating |FRAME:NAcMur-Peptide-Undecaprenols|, also known as lipid I.
Another transferase then adds |FRAME:UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, yielding the complete monomeric unit |FRAME:NAcMur-Peptide-NAcGlc-Undecaprenols|, also known as lipid II.

This final lipid intermediate is transferred by an as yet unknown mechanism through the membrane. The peptidoglycan monomers are then polymerized on the outside surface by glycosyltransferases, which form the linear glycan chains, and transpeptidases, which catalyze the formation of peptide crosslinks |CITS: [11320055]|. While some of these enzymes are mono-functional, a group of bifunctional proteins possessing both glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activity plays a major role in this process in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These bifunctional proteins are known as |FRAME: Class-A-PBPs \"Class A Penicillin-binding Proteins\"| (PBPs) |CITS: [9791115]|.

Peptide crosslinks form between different parts of the peptides depending on the organism. For example, in Mycobacteria and in |FRAME:TAX-562| most links form between the carboxyl group of the penultimate |FRAME: D-ALANINE| (residue 4) of one peptide to the amino group at the D-center of |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| (residue 3) of an adjacent peptide of a second glycan chain (as in |FRAME:TAX-562|). The crosslinking reaction is catalyzed by transpeptidases and involves the cleavage of the D-alanyl-D-alanine bond of the donor peptide, providing the energy to drive the reaction. As a result, the peptides in the peptidoglycan polymers are one or two amino acids shorter than the peptides in the monomers.
The transpeptidases include either the bifunctional protein described above (|FRAME: Class-A-PBPs \"Class A PBPs\"|) or monofunctional proteins,  known as |FRAME: Class-B-PBPs \"Class B PBPs\"|.

<b>About the variability of peptidoglycan composition</b>

Peptidoglycan is the only cell wall polymer common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as cyanobacteria.
The composition and structure of peptidoglycan is rather constant among Gram-negative bacteria.
Significant variability is found among Gram-positive bacteria, and is discussed in |FRAME: PWY-5265|.

The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmpspheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria.
This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as \"basal structure\", \"mucopeptide\", \"glycopeptide\", \"glycosaminopeptide\" and \"murein\"). Peptidoglycan is found on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane of almost all eubacteria, and is unique to these organisms.

Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.
The glycan moiety of the peptidoglycan is remarkably uniform among all bacteria, and is made up of alternating &beta;-1,4-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and <i>N</i>-acetyl muramate residues, with an average chain length (in different organisms) of 10 to 65 disaccharide units (although it is about 5000 in |FRAME: TAX-1423|). The peptide moiety is less uniform, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5265|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway describes the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan in Mycobacteria. The Mycobacterial peptidoglycan is similar to that found in |FRAME:TAX-562|, with one main difference: the membrane acceptor portion of the molecule is the unusual |FRAME: CPD-11994|, instead of the much more common |FRAME:UNDECAPRENYL-P|.

As in other bacteria, the peptidoglycan monomer precursor |FRAME:UDP-NAcMur-Peptides| is produced in the cytoplasm by six enzymes (see |FRAME: PWY-6387|). This molecule is then attached to |FRAME: CPD-11994| by a transferase encoded by |FRAME: G185E-6364|, generating |FRAME:CPD-11997|, also known as lipid I.

A second transferase, encoded by |FRAME: G185E-6361|, then adds |FRAME:UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, yielding lipid II, which carries the full monomer unit, |FRAME: CPD-11998|.

This final lipid intermediate is transferred by an as yet unknown mechanism through the membrane, and the peptidoglycan monomers are then polymerized on the outside surface by glycosyltransferases, which form the linear glycan chains, and transpeptidases, which catalyze the formation of peptide cross-links |CITS: [11320055]|. 

Most of the cross-links in Mycobacteria are between the the carboxyl group of the penultimate |FRAME: D-ALANINE| (residue 4) of one peptide to the amino group at the D-center of |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| (residue 3) of an adjacent peptide of a second glycan chain (as in |FRAME:TAX-562|). The reaction is catalyzed by D-D transpeptidases also known as |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins \"penicillin-binding proteins\"| (PBPs), and involves the cleavage of the D-alanyl-D-alanine bond of the donor peptide, providing the energy to drive the reaction.

However, about third of the linkages are between the carboxyl group at the L-center of a |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| of one chain and the amino group at the D-center of the |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| of another peptide side chain, resulting in an L,D-cross-link |CITS: [4210702 ]|. In stationary phase bacteria up to 80% of the cross-links were in the L,D form |CITS:[18408028]|. The |FRAME: G185E-4233-MONOMER| has been identified as the product of the |FRAME: G185E-4233| gene |CITS: [18408028]|. The prevalance of L,D cross-links enables the bacteria to resist &beta;-lactam antiobiotics."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-1586"	"peptidoglycan maturation (<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate containing)"	"PWY0-1586"	"The peptidoglycan (PG) or murein sacculus of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is assembled from monomer subunits of the disaccharide pentapeptide, <i>N</i>-acetyl-(<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-<I>meso</I>-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (also known as GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide) which are synthesized in the cytoplasm as lipid linked molecules (lipid II) and then flipped across the inner membrane by a flippase protein (see |FRAME: PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|). Mature peptidoglycan is assembled on the outer face of the inner membrane through the action of transglycosylases, transpeptidases and peptidoglycan hydrolases. 

Peptidoglycan is a heterogeneous polymer; the length of mature glycan strands varies |CITS: [2285138][3292521]| - the average degree of oligomerization is about 25 to 40 disaccharide units |CITS: [17658458]| - and may be affected by growth conditions. The length of the peptide stem also varies - di-, tri-, tetra- and pentapeptide muropeptides have all been identified - as have different levels of cross-linkage from monomeric peptides to tetrameric peptides |CITS: [3292521]|. Growing glycan chains remain linked to the lipid carrier (<i>di-trans,octa-cis</i>-undecaprenyl phosphate); the terminal residues of released strands are GlcNAc and 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc |CITS: [357]| however the mechanism resulting in release remains unknown - lytic transglycosylases which cleave PG producing 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc muropeptides during PG recycling and turnover do not seem to be involved (see |CITS: [22126997]|.

Transglycosylases catalyse the formation of a &beta;1 &rarr; 4 N-acetylmuramoyl-N-acetylglucosamine bond between a growing glycan chain and a newly flipped disaccharide pentapeptide monomer releasing a molecule of <i>di-trans,octa-cis</i>-undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP) for recycling in the process. It is not clear whether the growing glycan chain serves as glycosyl donor and the disaccharide monomer as acceptor or vice versa; evidence for the former has been presented (|CITS: [16351056]|). Transpeptidases cross link glycan strands within newly synthesized peptidoglycan and between newly made material and preexisting peptidoglycan; they also link peptidoglycan to Braun's lipoprotein (Lpp) in the outer membrane and catalyse the exchange of carboxy terminal D-alanine residues with glycine in the peptide stem. 

DD-transpeptidases catalyse the cross-linking of the glycan strands between the the D-alanine at position 4 of a pentapeptide stem and the meso-diaminopimelyl residue (m-A<sub>2</sub>pm) at position 3 of a separate tetrapeptide stem (a D-Ala &rarr; m-A<sub>2</sub>pm cross-link); LD transpeptidases catalyse the cross link between two m-A<sub>2</sub>pm residues of separate stems. <i>E. coli K-12</i> contains bifunctional transglycosylases/DD transpeptidases (|FRAME: CPLX0-7717 \"MrcA\"| also known as penicillin binding protein 1A or PBP1A, |FRAME: CPLX0-3951 \"MrcB\"|/PBP1B and |FRAME: G7322-MONOMER \"PbpC\"|/PBP1C) |CITS: [7006606][16840781][7001458][10542235]|, monofunctional DD transpeptidases (|FRAME: EG10606-MONOMER \"MrdA\"|/PBP2, |FRAME: EG10341-MONOMER \"FtsI\"|/PBP3) |CITS: [6297485][3531167]|, a monofunctional transglycosylase (|FRAME: G7668-MONOMER \"MtgA\"|) |CITS: [8772200]| and 2 LD transpeptidases (|FRAME: EG11253-MONOMER \"LdtD\"| and |FRAME: G6904-MONOMER \"LdtE\"|) which form m-A<sub>2</sub>pm &rarr; m-A<sub>2</sub>pm cross links within peptidoglycan |CITS: [18456808]|.  A further three LD-transpeptidases (|FRAME: G7073-MONOMER \"LdtA\"|, |FRAME: G6571-MONOMER \"LdtC\"| and |FRAME: G6422-MONOMER \"LdtB\"|) cleave the m-A<sub>2</sub>pm-d-Ala peptide bond of a peptidoglycan donor stem and link the m-A<sub>2</sub>pm residue to the the C-terminal lysine residue of Braun's lipoprotein and catalyse the exchange of D-alanine with glycine in tetrapeptide stems |CITS: [17369299][18456808]|.   

The murein of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 is characterised by the presence of 'free' penta-, tetra-, and tripeptide stems (ie. stems not involved in cross linkages) in varying proportions. Pentapeptide stems are converted to tetrapeptides by the action of DD carboxypeptidases (primarily |FRAME: EG10201-MONOMER \"DacA or PBP5\"|) which remove the C-terminal D-alanine residue |CITS: [7002918]| while tripeptide stems are formed by cleavage of the (L)-<i>meso</i>-A<sub>2</sub>pm &rarr;D-Ala bond of tetrapeptide stems. This latter reaction is catalysed by the LD-transpeptidase enzymes (LdtA, LdtB, LdtC, LdtD and LdtE) which also have LD-carboxypeptidase activity |CITS: [18456808]|. The amount of dipeptide subunits in isolated murein is low and the mechanism by which they might be formed is not clear.

Please note: This pathway has been designed to include many of the reactions that are involved during the assembly of nascent peptidoglycan but the heterogeneous nature of the mature polymer precludes depiction by a single pathway. This pathway does not depict the insertion of newly made peptidoglycan into the existing sacculus - several models for this process have been proposed (see |CITS: [17658458]|). The insertion of new material requires cleavage of mature peptidoglycan and <i>E. coli</i> contains a variety of peptidoglycan hydrolases which cleave the glycoside and amide bonds of mature peptidoglycan (reviewed in |CITS: [22126997]|). There is a significant turnover of peptidoglycan during cell growth and this is accompanied by recycling of the turnover products for reuse (see |FRAME: PWY0-1261| and |FRAME: PWY0-1546|).

While they protect the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 

Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A \"lipid A\"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; the |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides \"core oligosaccharide\"|, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.

Lipid A, which is common to most Gram-negative bacteria, is the most toxic part and elicits the strongest immune response. Despite some variability in its structure, it is rather conserved among species. The core oligosaccharide, which contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, is genus-specific, and and the <i>O</i>-antigen side chains vary greatly in their structure and toxicity. The polysaccharide usually contains of about 20-40 repeats of the <i>O</i>-antigen basic monomeric unit.

|FRAME: KDO \"3-Deoxy-D-<i>manno</i>-octulosonate\"| (known as Kdo, which is an acronym for its old name ketodeoxyoctonate) is a part of the inner core of lipopolysaccharides. It is added to the lipid A precursor |FRAME: LIPID-IV-A| in sequential steps, with different Kdo units added by different linkages. The first unit is always added by a (2->6) glycosidic linkage and the second one by a (2->4) linkage.

Bacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-810| genus contain a genus-specific epitope that consists of the trisccharide &alpha;-Kdo-(2->8)-&alpha;-Kdo-(2->4)-&alpha;-Kdo (in the form of |FRAME: CPD-12281|) |CITS: [7686488][7515346]|. 

The third Kdo unit in this epitope was shown to be attached by the same enzyme that attaches the other two units. The |FRAME: G-11884| gene of |FRAME: TAX-83558| strain TW-183 that encodes this enzyme has been cloned and expressed in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1718|, which lacks any LPS biosynthetic background. The host bacterium produced |FRAME: CPD-12281|, confirming that the enzyme acts as a trifunctional glycosyltransferase |CITS: [8748024]|.

When the |FRAME: G-11886| of |FRAME: TAX-331636| was cloned and expressed in a rough mutant of |FRAME:TAX-562|,
the LPS produced by the mutant was shown to contain two additional products - |FRAME: CPD-12284| and |FRAME: CPD-12285|. Thus this enzyme enables the formation of at least five different bonds |CITS: [7744029]|."

With glucose as a substrate, |FRAME: TAX-2336| produces lactate, acetate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen as the main fermentation products.
Glucose degradation to pyruvate occurs via the conventional Embden-Meyerhof pathway (see |FRAME:ANAGLYCOLYSIS-PWY|  |CITS: [ArchMicr161-460] [8791626] [9075622] [2318202]|.

In this pathway |FRAME:CPLX-1868| replaces the NAD-utilizing |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY| that |FRAME:TAX-562| and other organisms use to convert pyruvate to |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P41-PWY|)."

dissipation of the proton motive force, disruption of CoA homeostasis, and, in some cases,
inhibition of the key TCA enzymes aconitase and citrate synthase due to formation of |FRAME: CPD-622|.
For these reasons propionate is sometimes used as a preservative in foods.
However, some bacteria are able to degrade propionate, and even use it the sole carbon source. Out
of all the propionate degradation pathways, the 2-methylcitric acid cycle is the most widely destributed.
In this pathway, the C&alpha; methylene group of propionate is oxidized to a keto group yielding
|FRAME:PYRUVATE|, a common precursor for biosynthesis and energy production.

The pathway, which was discovered in fungi |CITS: [Tabuchi74]| was best characterized in
|FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS:[10482501][11294638]| (see |FRAME: PWY0-42|).
In that organism the pathway begins with the activation of |FRAME: PROPIONATE| to
|FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| by |FRAME: MONOMER-62|, followed by the synthesis of
|FRAME: CPD-622| from |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| and |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID|, catalyzed
by |FRAME: MONOMER-63|. |FRAME: CPD-622| is then dehydrated to |FRAME: CPD-1136| by
|FRAME: MONOMER-64|, followed by rehydration to |FRAME: CPD-618| (catalyzed by
|FRAME: MONOMER-65| and |FRAME: MONOMER-13618|) and cleavage of the later into
|FRAME:PYRUVATE| and |FRAME:SUC|, performed by |FRAME: CPLX-7556|. 

As mentioned above, pyruvate is a common precursor for biosynthesis and energy production.
Oxaloacetate may be regenerated from succinate via the |FRAME:TCA| |CITS: [10482501]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

A key reaction in the |FRAME: TAX-90371| pathway catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-622| to
|FRAME: CPD-1136|. This reaction is catalyzed by the |FRAME: MONOMER-64| enzyme, encoded by
the |FRAME: G-10383| gene. Some organisms do not have this enzyme, and thus utilize a different
variant of the pathway. These organism use a combination of two enzymes, encoded by the
|FRAME: G-10386| and |FRAME: G-10387| enzymes |CITS:[11495997][14702315]|. Characterization of
the proteins revealed that the |FRAME: G-10386| gene product is a |FRAME: MONOMER-13619|, 
while the |FRAME: G-10387| gene product is an isomerase that catalyzes the transfer between
|FRAME: CPD-9421| and |FRAME: CPD-1136|. Since both proteins are required for the pathway to
proceed, the dehydratase must produce a stereoisomer of 2-methylaconitate that is not a substrate for
the aconitate hydratase enzyme, which catalyzes the next step, and thus this stereoisomer must be
converted by |FRAME: CPLX-7555| to the different form |CITS: [17567742]|.

The Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-106590| possesses both a <i>prpD</i> gene and  the <i>acnD</i>
(called <i>acnM</i> in that organism) and <i>prpF</i> genes. However, it was shown by gene
inactivation that while the <i>prpD</i> gene was dispensible, the latter two genes were required for growth
on propionate, suggesting that the organism is utilizing this variant of the pathway |CITS: [11495997]|.
In addition, |FRAME: TAX-106590|, like several other organisms, lack the <i>prpE</i> gene. It is assumed that
in these organisms |FRAME:MONOMER-13637| is responsible for propionate activation |CITS:[11495997]|."

Many organisms including bacteria, fungi, metazoa, and plants can degrade glucose polymers derived from |FRAME: Starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| (see pathways |FRAME: PWY-6724|, |FRAME: PWY-842|, |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5941|).  Some hyperthermophilic archaea have also been shown to produce |FRAME: Starch|-degrading enzymes, and pathways for the utilization of |FRAME: Starch| and its derivatives, such as |FRAME: Cyclodextrins|, |FRAME: Maltodextrins|, and |FRAME: MALTOSE| have been proposed.  These hyperthermophilic archaea can utilize |FRAME: Starch| and its degradation products as primary carbon sources during anaerobic growth.  Thermostable starch-degrading enzymes produced by hyperthermophilic organisms are of industrial interest |CITS: [16513741] [11489857] [17921308] [11702074]|.

|FRAME: TAX-186497| was shown to degrade |FRAME: Starch| mainly via maltodextrins in a pathway involving an extracellular amylopullulanase, a transporter, an intracellular 4-&alpha;-glucanotransferase, and a maltodextrin phosphorylase, as described below in <b>About This Pathway</b> (|CITS: [16513741]| and in |CITS: [17921308]|).

The sulfate-reducing archaeon |FRAME: ORG-6178| has been shown to degrade |FRAME: Starch| via a unique pathway involving cyclodextrin intermediates |CITS: [17921308] [11702074]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6731|).

In the hyperthermophilic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-91619| evidence suggested a |FRAME: Starch| degradation pathway via formation of cyclodextrins from |FRAME: Starch| extracellularly by a |FRAME: MONOMER-16282|, transport of cyclodextrins into the cell, and their degradation by a |FRAME: MONOMER-16283| to the end products |FRAME: MALTOSE| and |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE| (|CITS: [11489857]| and in |CITS: [17921308]|) (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6735|).

Among bacteria |FRAME:TAX-562| cannot utilize |FRAME: Starch|, but it can metabolize short, linear maltodextrins (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|).  However the enterobacterium |FRAME: TAX-290336| can utilize |FRAME: Starch| as a sole source of carbon and energy.  Mutant analysis suggested that it metabolizes |FRAME: Starch| by two pathways.  The first was a proposed maltose/maltodextrin pathway involving extracellular degradation of |FRAME: Starch| by pullulanase and the disproportionation activity of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase to form linear maltodextins.  After transport into the cell they are degraded to |FRAME: GLC| and |FRAME: GLC-1-P| by the products of <i>malP</i>, <i>malQ</i> and <i>malZ</i>.  The second was a proposed cyclodextrin pathway involving extracellular conversion of |FRAME: Starch| to cyclodextrins (see |FRAME: Cyclodextrins|) by cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, transport into the cell, linearization by |FRAME: MONOMER-16314| (CymH) |CITS: [8599539]|, and further catabolism as in the maltose/maltodextrin pathway |CITS: [8594196] [9573146]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The hyperthermophilic archaeon |FRAME: TAX-186497| is an obligately anaerobic heterotroph that is able to utilize a variety of sugars as a primary carbon source.  Its genome encodes many glycosyl hydrolases and transferases, the physiological function of which are unclear.  Using global transcriptional profiling data and biochemical studies |CITS: [16513741]| have defined the pathway for starch metabolism in |FRAME: TAX-186497|.  This pathway involves an |FRAME: MONOMER-16303| (PF1935*) acting extracellularly, and |FRAME: MONOMER-16304| (PF0272), |FRAME: MONOMER-16305| (maltodextrin phosphorylase) (PF1535) and phosphoglucomutase (PF0588) acting intracellularly.  Although other candidates for |FRAME: Starch| degrading enzymes were annotated in the |FRAME: TAX-186497| genome, they did not appear to be functionally involved in |FRAME: Starch| degradation (|CITS: [16513741]| and in |CITS: [17921308]|).

In this pathway |FRAME: Starch| is degraded extracellularly by |FRAME: MONOMER-16303| which has both pullulanase and &alpha;-amylase activity.  Products of its &alpha;-amylase activity include maltodextrins (see |FRAME: Maltodextrins|), |FRAME: MALTOSE| and |FRAME: D-Glucose| |CITS: [15599521] [9293009]|.  Two active transporters Mal-II and Mal-I transport maltodextrins and |FRAME: MALTOSE| respectively, into the cell |CITS: [15803655]|.  A |FRAME: MONOMER-16304| generates |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE| from |FRAME: MALTOSE| and maltodextrins.  |FRAME: MONOMER-16305| (maltodextrin phosphorylase) converts maltodextrins to |FRAME: GLC-1-P| |CITS: [16513741]|.

The |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE| and |FRAME: GLC-1-P| produced in the pathway are proposed to enter the novel glycolytic pathway of this organism after conversion of the latter compound to |FRAME: ALPHA-GLC-6-P| by phosphoglucomutase (EC 5.4.2.2) |CITS: [16513741]|.  In aqueous solution the epimers |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE| and |FRAME: GLC| spontaneously interconvert, forming an equilibrium mixture |CITS: [FRANKS87]|.  Likewise, |FRAME: ALPHA-GLC-6-P| exists in equilibrium with its epimer |FRAME: GLC-6-P|.  These reactions can also be enzyme-catalyzed.  Whether the &alpha;, &beta;, or both &alpha; and &beta; epimers are used depends upon the anomeric specificity of the enzymes that utilize these compounds.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY"	"glycogen biosynthesis I (from ADP-D-Glucose)"	"GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY"	"<b>General Background</b>

Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer that serves as a form of energy storage in animals and fungi. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called \"animal starch\".

Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 710% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.

Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).
Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal value for the particle size above which further growth is impossible as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. This generates a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter including 55 000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.

Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

Glucose is polymerized within the polysaccharides thanks to its activation in the form of a nucleotide-sugar through the action of NDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. All eukaryotes known synthesize glycogen from |FRAME: CPD-12575| while all Gram-negative glycogen accumulating bacteria use |FRAME:ADP-D-GLUCOSE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5067| and |FRAME:GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|).

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Unlike |FRAME: CPD-12575|, which is used by all living cells to synthesize a large number of different molecules, |FRAME:ADP-D-GLUCOSE| is devoted to the synthesis of glycogen in bacteria (and also to the synthesis of the osmoprotectant glucosylglycerol in cyanobacteria). Thus, the synthesis of ADP-glucose defines the first committed step of glycogen synthesis in bacteria while glucan elongation defines the first committed step of eukaryotic glycogen synthesis. The enzyme catalyzing this reaction, |FRAME: EC-2.7.7.27|, is rate-limiting for the pathway. 

The glucose from the glycosyl-nucleotide is transferred to the non-reducing end of either a maltodextrin or a glycogen primer forming a new &alpha;-1,4-glucosidic linkage in an elongation reaction catalysed by |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.21 \"EC 2.4.1.21, glycogen synthase\"|.

After chain elongation the formation of the branched &alpha;-1,6-glucosidic linkages is catalyzed by the glycogen branching enzyme. Branching proceeds differently through an hydrolytic cleavage of a pre-existing &alpha;-1,4-linked glucan synthesized through glycogen synthase and an intra or intermolecular transfer of a segment of chain in the &alpha;-1,6 position."

The process is essentially the reversal of the |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| pathway. However, two glycolytic enzymes catalyze irreversible reactions. In order to enable the pathway to flow in the direction of glucose production, these reactions are catalyzed by other enzymes (|FRAME:EC-3.1.3.11| and |FRAME:EC-2.7.9.2|) in the opposite direction.

Enzymes of the gluconeogenic pathway are widely distributed in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and are often considered to be central to the origins of metabolism |CITS: [15803666]|. Note that this pathway describes gluconeogenesis in plants and microorganisms, the mammalian pathway is described at |FRAME: PWY66-399|.

Bacteria use gluconeogenesis to synthesize glucose from non-sugar C2 or C3 compounds or the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle when there sufficient amounts of hexose are not available to them |CITS: [9168612][11815613][16109965][20439709]|.

In photosynthetic organisms, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation (|FRAME: GAP|) is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm, where it is transformed to hexose phosphate via gluconeogenesis. In plants, these hexose phosphates are used to synthesize sucrose, as documented in |FRAME: PWY-7347| |CITS: [Sung88]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=CALVIN-PWY"	"Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle"	"CALVIN-PWY"	"The Calvin cycle is the major |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| fixation pathway, found in all in green plants and many autotrophic bacteria.

In this cycle, one |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecule at a time is added to the acceptor molecule |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| (RuBP) generating two molecules of |FRAME: G3P|. The |FRAME: G3P| is then passed through a cyclic series of reactions in which the acceptor molecule (RuBP) is regenerated. Out of the six carbons present in two molecules of |FRAME: G3P|, five are recycled and only one remains available for biosynthesis. Since in each turn of the cycle only one carbon atom is assimilated, the cycle must go through three turns to produce one molecule of |FRAME: G3P|, or six turns to produce one molecule of a hexose sugar.

The Calvin cycle can be divided into three stages: fixation, reduction and regeneration.

In the first stage the reductive carboxylation of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| (RuBP) is catalyzed by the the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-105| (RubisCO), forming 2 molecules of |FRAME: G3P|. 

In the second stage these two molecules are phosphorylated to |FRAME: DPG| and then reductively dephosphorylated to |FRAME: GAP|. In three turns of the cycle 3 molecules of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| are fixed, and 6 molecules of |FRAME: GAP| are formed. Out of these, one is diverted to biosynthetic pathways, while the other 5 are used up in the next stage.

The third stage is the most complicated one. It consists of a series of rearrangements that eventually regenerate RuBP.
Some of the |FRAME:GAP| molecules are converted to |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|. |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| are then condensed into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE| which is dephosphorylated to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|. |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| is then combined with another |FRAME: GAP| molecule and cleaved into |FRAME:XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE| (X5P) and |FRAME:ERYTHROSE-4P|. The later is combined with |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| forming |FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-1-7-P2|, which is dephosphorylated to |FRAME:D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|. 
|FRAME:D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P| is combined with |FRAME: GAP| and is cleaved into a second |FRAME:XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE| and a |FRAME:RIBOSE-5P| (R5P). Both of these are converted into |FRAME:RIBULOSE-5P|, which is finally phosphorylated to |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2|, regenerating the key |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|-acceptor molecule.

During this cycle, especially during the day, |FRAME: G3P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, or |FRAME:GAP| can be siphoned off and sent out to the cytosol via the triose phosphates transporter for |FRAME: SUCSYN-PWY|.

together by single-atom bridges between the &alpha; positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings.
Tetrapyrroles usually function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments,
such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.

The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway shown here beginning
with glycine and succinyl-CoA (a TCA cycle intermediate) is found in animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa (such
as the malaria parasite |FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [15144063]|), and members of the
&alpha;-proteobacteria.  In other bacteria (including |FRAME:TAX-562|) and archaea, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis
begins with glutamate instead of glycine (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|). Plants, who biosynthesize
tetrapyrrole for use as heme and chlorophyll, also synthesize it from glutamate.
Interestingly, the chloroplast-containing protozoan |FRAME: TAX-3039| possesses both pathways.

Regardless whether the starting point is glycine or glutamate, both pathways converge at the intermediate
|FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE| and proceed through the important intermediate
|FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|, which is a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of different
tetrapyrrole compounds, such as the corrinoid cobalamine
(vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: P381-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5507|),
the methanogenic coenzyme F<sub>430</sub> (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME|
(see |FRAME: PWY-5194|), and heme D.

This pathway has been studied in the photosynthetic purple nonsulfur &alpha;-proteobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1063|, which posesses two chromosomes and five additional replicons. In this organism there are two genes encoding  5-aminolevulinate synthase, |FRAME: G-9025| and |FRAME:G-10074|, that are present on chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively.
Biosynthesis of the tetrapyrrole cofactors |FRAME: Hemes|, |FRAME: CPD-9067|, |FRAME: SIROHEME| and |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN| in this organism is highly regulated and is dependent upon expression of these two isozymes (in |CITS: [7592416], [10491185]|)."

Tetrapyrroles function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.
The biosynthesis of all of these cofactors start in a similar manner, with the production of the intermediate |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|. This intermediate is an important branch point: its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or cofactor F430 synthesis, while decarboxylation directs it toward the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll |CITS: [14633982]|.

The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway shown here, which starts with glutamate, is found in plants, many bacteria (including |FRAME:TAX-562|), and the archaea. A second tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, which is found in animals, fungi, certain protozoans, and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, starts with glycine and succinyl-coA (see

polymerizations to form various polyisoprenoids.

There are two different pathways for the biosynthesis of IPP. Bacteria that possess ubiquinone generally
use the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| (MEP), while the eukaryotic microorganisms use the
|FRAME: PWY-922|. However, exceptions exist - for example, some eukaryotic microbes, like the green
algae and the malarial parasite |FRAME: TAX-5833|, appear to utilize the MEP pathway,
and some bacteria utilze the mevalonate pathway |CITS:[11173292][15197467]|.

In |FRAME: TAX-83333| the initial addition of two isoprenyl units to form |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| is
catalyzed by |FRAME: FPPSYN-MONOMER|, and further polymerizations are carried out by additional
enzymes, depending on the configuration.
Additions in the <i>trans</i> configuration are carried out by |FRAME: CPLX0-7426|, while addition in
the <i>cis</i> configuration is catalyzed by |FRAME: UPPSYN-CPLX|.

In |FRAME:TAX-562|, the <i>trans</i>-polyisoprenoid pathway continues to form
|FRAME: OCTAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE|, which is utilized in the |FRAME: UBISYN-PWY| and
|FRAME: MENAQUINONESYN-PWY| pathways for formation the inner membrane electron carriers
ubiquinone, menaquinone, and demethylmenaquinone.

The <i>cis,trans</i>-polyisoprenoid pathway continues to form
|FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE|, the precursor for |FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-P|, which
functions as the carrier lipid in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, enterobacterial common antigen
and lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

|FRAME:TAX-562| are phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin.
All phospholipids contain <I>sn</I>-glycerol-3-phosphate esterified with fatty
acids at the <I>sn</I>-1 and <I>sn</I>-2 positions. 

In addition to providing the membrane matrix, phospholipids are also involved in
synthesizing several types of surface molecules. The phosphoethanolamine head
groups of phosphatidylethanolamine are transferred and attached to the 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core sugars and to periplasmic membrane-derived 
oligosaccharides (MDO). The head group of phosphatidylglycerol is used for 
modifying various lipoproteins and MDO. The entire molecule is used in the 
synthesis of cardiolipin.   |CITS: [2404013] [ColiSalII]|"		"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-1545" // "HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-1319" //

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=FASYN-ELONG-PWY"	"fatty acid elongation -- saturated"	"FASYN-ELONG-PWY"	"This pathway shows the reactions that constitute one turn of a cycle that lengthens the chain of an acyl-[acyl-carrier protein] molecule by two carbons. The pathway is fed acetoacetyl-[acp] (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|), which  is a substrate of the second reaction shown here.

The products of multiple turns of this cycle are drawn off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds, such as phospholipids, lipid A, and lipoproteins. They comprise saturated fatty acids such as |FRAME: DODECANOATE| (dodecanoate), |FRAME: CPD-7836| (tetradecanoate), |FRAME: PALMITATE| (hexadecanoate), and |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| (octadecanoate).

In |FRAME: TAX-562|, of the four reactions involved in a cycle of fatty-acid elongation, two are catalyzed by more that one enzyme. These function preferentially on substrates of different chain length. They also act differentially on saturated and unsaturated substrates |CITS: [8910376]|.

The first reaction in the sequence, the condensation reaction, is catalyzed in |FRAME:TAX-562| by three enzymes, FabB, FabF, and FabH. However, FabH initiates fatty-acid synthesis: it uses only acetyl-[acp] as a substrate, and is thus not included in this pathway (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) |CITS: [14523010]|. Other organisms may use other initiation enzymes, such as |FRAME: G-15300 FabY|.

Bacteria such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562| </i> also contain unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed by a pathway that branches at the level of the 10-carbon intermediate (see |FRAME:PWY0-862|) |CITS: [14527277][8246839]|.
FabB, but not FabF, participates in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [11566998]|. The activity of FabF, and hence the fraction of fatty acids that are saturated, is modultated by temperature. However, the distribution of the flow of synthesis that proceeds to saturated vs. unsaturated fatty acids is determined mostly by the activities of FabA and FabZ |CITS: [8910376]|.

The final step of the cycle, the reductase, is known to be catalzed by enzymes that utilize either NADH, or NADPH, or both |CITS: [9022698]|. The |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: EG11528 FabI| can use both cofactors, although the activity with NADH was shown to be over 17-fold higher than with NADPH |CITS: [9022698]|. |FRAME: G-15301 FabV| and |FRAME: G-15302 FabK| are NADH-specific. FabV enzymes are common in Gram-negative bacteria, and have been described from multiple organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-208964| |CITS: [19933806]|, |FRAME: TAX-13373| |CITS: [20055482]|, |FRAME: TAX-347| |CITS: [22039545]|, |FRAME: TAX-668| |CITS: [22232178]|, and |FRAME: TAX-632| |CITS: [22244758]|. FabK enzymes are found only in some Gram-positive bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-1313| |CITS: [10910344][12487627]| and |FRAME: TAX-837| |CITS: [22820244]|. Another isoform, |FRAME: BSU08650 FabL|, which is found in |FRAME: TAX-1423| and some other Gram-positive bacteria, uses only NADPH |CITS: [11007778]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=FASYN-INITIAL-PWY"	"superpathway of fatty acid biosynthesis initiation (E. coli)"	"FASYN-INITIAL-PWY"	"<b>General Background</b>

Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are
determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|,
and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.

There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in
mammals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid (see
|FRAME: CPLX-7628| from |FRAME: TAX-9606|), while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast)
consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex
(see |FRAME: CPLX-7627| from |FRAME: TAX-4932|).

Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794|
phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|.
The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each
encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as
thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.

The best studied pathway is that of |FRAME: TAX-83333|, from which all the enzymes have been purified
and crystalized. In plants fatty acid synthesis occurs mainly in plastids of leaf mesophyll cells, seeds,
and oil-accumulating fruits. Although most of the synthesis occurrs in plastids, it has been shown that
mitochondria are also capable of synthesizing fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|.

Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|,
an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately
produce the final fatty acid products. This superpathway describes only the initiation sequence,
subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and
|FRAME: PWY0-862|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

|FRAME: TAX-83333| has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, using
different combinations of its three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS),
|FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|,
which are encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.
In general, the |FRAME: EG10277|-encoded enzyme is responsible for the initiation of fatty acid
elongation, utilizing acyl-coA primers, while the |FRAME: EG10274|/|FRAME: EG12606| products
are responsible for the subsequent rounds of elongation, condensing malonyl-ACP with different length
acyl-ACPs to extend the acyl chain by two carbons |CITS: [15952903][18384517]|.

Three pathways for the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis have been proposed |CITS: [1551888]|.

In the first pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-4381|) |FRAME: CPLX0-252| catalyzes the condensation of
|FRAME: ACETYL-COA| with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| to yield |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|.

In the second pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-5966|) the acetate moiety is first transferred from
|FRAME: ACETYL-COA| to |FRAME: ACETYL-ACP| by |FRAME:ACP-S-ACETYLTRANSFER-ENZRXN|
(this is a second function of |FRAME: CPLX0-252|; it is not clear whether an additional dedicated
enzyme exists in the organism). The acetyl-ACP is then condensed with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|
by |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| (or alternatively |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX|).

The third pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-5965|) involves the decarboxylation of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|
by |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| to form |FRAME: ACETYL-ACP| followed by subsequent condensation with
a second |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|.

It is now believed that |FRAME: CPLX0-252| is the key enzyme in the initiation of fatty acids biosynthesis
|CITS: [15952903]|. It selectively catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP and specifically uses CoA
thioesters rather than acyl-ACP as the primer. The products tend to be shorter than the products of KASI
and II, which are involved primarily in elongation reactions, and unlike the other two enzymes, KASIII
cannot participate in the terminal elongation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis.

While |FRAME: FABB-CPLX| and |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| have been shown <i>in
vitro</i> to utilize substrates with short acyl moieties, forming acetoacetyl-ACP,
the importance of these enzyme for initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis <i>in vivo</i> is not clear
|CITS: [15952903]|.

|FRAME: G-15300|-mutants are defficient in fatty acid biosynthesis. However, this phenotype can be suppressed by supplementation of the growth media with exogenous fatty acids with chain lengths of eight or more carbons |CITS: [22753057]|. Upon transport into the cell the fatty acids form acyl-CoA thioesters, which are catabolized by the &beta;-oxidation cycle.

Studies showed that when |FRAME: CPD-196| is formed, it can be shunted into the fatty acid elongation cycle by a dedicated enzyme, encoded by the |FRAME: G-15305| gene |CITS: [22753057]|. This enzyme, which has a storng preference for |FRAME: CPD-196| (although |FRAME: CPD-10267| is also used at a lower rate), condenses the acyl-CoA thioester with |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP malonyl-[acp]|, forming |FRAME: 3-oxo-decanoyl-ACPs \"3-oxo-decanoyl-[acp]\"|, an intermediate of the fatty acid elongation cycle, thus by-passing the limitation imposed by lack of initiation, and enabling fatty acid biosynthesis.

The presence of this shunt may curtail the efficacy of inhibitors targeting the |FRAME: G-15300 FabY| initiator."

Mycolic acids are the hallmark of the cell envelope of |FRAME: TAX-1773| and related species and genera. They comprise a homologous series of C60-C90 (2<i>R</i>)-alkyl-(3<i>R</i>)-hydroxy very long-chain fatty acids, and are found as either esters of |FRAME: Arabinogalactan| or as free lipids in the form of trehalose dimycolate (TDM). Both forms contribute to forming the two leaflets of the mycobacterial outer membrane, also called the mycomembrane, which protects the organism from antibiotics and the host's immune system  |CITS: [15653820][17555433][15353567]|.

There is a significant variability in the structure of mycolic acids among different species. Acids from |FRAME: TAX-1716| species contain 22-38 carbon atoms, |FRAME: TAX-697025| and |FRAME: TAX-697025| spp. contain 30-36, |FRAME: TAX-37914| spp. contain 34-38, |FRAME: TAX-1827| spp. contain 34-52 in, |FRAME: TAX-1817| spp. contain 46-60, |FRAME: TAX-2053 <i>Gordonia</i>| spp. contain 46-66, |FRAME: TAX-2060| spp. contain 64-78 , |FRAME: TAX-1763| spp. contain 60-90, and |FRAME: TAX-286801| spp. contain up to 100 carbon atoms |CITS: [24374164]|.

The acids are formed by a Claisen-type condensation of two components - the meromycolic chain and a fatty acid.
Several structural classes of mycolic acids exist. In |FRAME: TAX-1773| the most apolar ones, known as &alpha;-mycolic acids, contain 74-80 carbon atoms (out of which 22-26 carbons are located in the fatty acid moiety and the rest on the mero-chain) and generally two double bonds (that can be in either <i>cis</i>- or <i>trans</i>-configuration) or two <i>cis</i>-cyclopropyl groups located in the meromycolic chain. The cyclopropane rings are believed to protect the organism from oxidative stress |CITS: [15653820]|. &alpha;-Mycolic acids usually comprise more than 70 percent of the total mycolic acids in the cell.

Other classes are defined by additional oxygen functions located in the distal part of the meromycolic chain, and include keto-, methoxy-, wax ester-, epoxy-, and hydroxy-types. In |FRAME: TAX-1773| the oxygenated mycolic acids (keto-, methoxy-, and hydroxy-types) contain ~84-88 carbon atoms, and are thus four to six carbons longer than the &alpha;-mycolic acids from the same strains.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The biosynthesis of mycolic acids could be divided conceptually into three parts: the biosynthesis of the fatty acid moiety, the biosynthesis of the mero-acid moiety, and the condensation of both parts.

The fatty acid moiety is produced by a \"eukaryotic-like\" multifunctional FAS-I enzyme complex (encoded by the |FRAME: G185E-6762 \"Rv2524C\"| gene), which produces C24-C26 acids (lignocerotate and cerotate), which are used as the \"&alpha; branch\" of the mycolic acids following carboxylation at position 2.

At the level of C22 (|FRAME: trans-delta2-behenoyl-ACPs \"<i>trans</i>-docos-2-enoyl-[acp]\"|) an isomerase encoded by |FRAME: G185E-5309| or |FRAME: G185E-5308| acts on some of the acids, transferring the double bond at position 2, which is introduced by the fatty acid dehydratase domain, to position 3. While those acids that were not affected by the isomerase continue elongation by FAS-I to the level of C26, the desaturated acid that result from isomerization, |FRAME: cis-delta3-behenoyl-ACPs \"<i>trans</i>-docos-3-enoyl-[acp]\"|, is no longer recognized by the FAS I enzyme. Instead, it is processed by a second, bacterial-like FAS-II system, which is composed of multiple discrete soluble enzymes (encoded by  |FRAME: G185E-6461|/|FRAME: G185E-6462|, |FRAME: G185E-5667|, |FRAME: CPLX-7729|/|FRAME: CPLX-7730|, and |FRAME: G185E-5668|. The longer fatty acids generated by FAS II eventually form the mero-chain moieties of the mycolic acids.

Although the two FAS systems differ in their molecular organizations, substrates, and carrier specificities, they share the typical reaction sequence, with an iterative series of reactions built on successive additions of a two-carbon unit from malonyl-CoA (FAS I) or malonyl-[acp] (FAS II) to the nascent acyl group.

During elongation by the FAS-II system, continuous introduction of 2-carbon units upstream of the the double bond at position 3 results in its \"migration\" farther from the carboxylate (to positions 5, 7, 9 etc). At the level of C35 the isomerase (encoded by echA10 or echA11) acts again, shifting another double bond from position 2 to position 3. This action of the isomerase results in a second branch in the pathway, where some of the acids continue with an additional double bond, while others continue without it. Both continue to be elongated by the FAS-II system.
The acids that escaped the isomeization at the C35 level undergo an isomerization at the level of C40. This isomerization event does not result in a branch in the pathway.

Following completion of the elongation process, the acids are modified by several additional enzymes which introduce methoxy groups and convert double bonds to cyclopropyl groups (including |FRAME: G185E-4788|, |FRAME: G185E-4787|, |FRAME: G185E-4786|, |FRAME: G185E-4785|, |FRAME: G185E-4597|, |FRAME: G185E-4635|). The final modified acids, as well as the final product of the FAS-I system, are then transferred from their [acp] and CoA carriers (respectively) to a polyketide enzyme, encoded by the |FRAME: G185E-8096| gene, which catalyzes their condensation into a mycolic acid |CITS: [14695899][15042094]|.

Additional enzymes catalyze the conjugation of the mycolic acids first to |FRAME: CPD1G-69| and subsequently to |FRAME: TREHALOSE-6P|. Following the removal of the phosphate, the free mycolic acid is exported to the periplasm, where it is attached to arabinogalactan in the cell wall, or to a second mycolic acid, forming a dimycolate."

|FRAME: CO-A \"Coenzyme A\"| (CoA) is a cofactor of ubiquitous occurrence in plants, bacteria, and animals needed in
a large number of enzymatic reactions central to intermediary metabolism, including the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Coenzyme A is the common acyl carrier in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells required for a multitude of reactions for both biosynthetic and degradative pathways amongst others forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy metabolism |CITS: [16415216]|.

The biosynthesis of CoA is of equal importance with regard to its recognition as a target for antibacterial drug discovery and to the association of human neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.33| |CITS: [15893380]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The CoA biosynthesis precursor |FRAME: 2-KETO-ISOVALERATE| is an intermediate in the synthesis of |FRAME: VAL| (see |FRAME: VALSYN-PWY|). This compound is converted in two steps to |FRAME: L-PANTOATE|, as shown in |FRAME: PANTO-PWY|.
The latter is converted into |FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE| is two steps, involving a &beta;-alanine ligase and a kinase.
In most organsims the ligase acts before the kinase (|FRAME: EC-6.3.2.1| followed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.33|, as described in |FRAME: PANTO-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-3961|. However, in archaea the order is reversed, and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.169| acts before |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.36|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6654|.

The kinases are feedback inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis.
The addition of |FRAME: CYS| to |FRAME: 4-P-PANTOTHENATE|, resulting in the formation of |FRAME: R-4-PHOSPHOPANTOTHENOYL-L-CYSTEINE| (PPC), is followed by decarboxylation of PPC to |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P|. The ultimate reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.24|, which converts 4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA. All enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth.

The reactions in the biosynthetic route towards CoA are identical in most organisms, although there are differences in the functionality of the involved enzymes. In plants every step is catalyzed by single monofunctional enzymes, whereas in bacteria and mammals bifunctional enzymes are often employed |CITS: [16415216]|.

In plants every step is catalyzed by single monofunctional enzymes, whereas in bacteria and mammals bifunctional enzymes are often employed |CITS: [16415216]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=ARO-PWY"	"chorismate biosynthesis I"	"ARO-PWY"	"|FRAME: CHORISMATE Chorismate| is an important intermediate that leads to the biosyntrhesis of several essential metabolites,
including the aromatic amino acids |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|, vitamins E and K, ubiquinone and certain siderophores |CITS: [4200844][2279393]|.

In this pathway, which is often referred to as <b>the shikimate pathway</b>, chorismate is synthesized from the central metabolite |FRAME:ERYTHROSE-4P|. 
The pathway is found in prokaryotes (mostly bacteria) and several eukaryotes, including ascomycete fungi, apicomplexans, plants and algae |CITS: [16963634]|. The presence of the pathway in many parasites and pathogens, but not in metazoa, makes it a prime drug target |CITS: [17348836]|. The broad-spectrum systemic herbicide |FRAME: CPD0-1308|, which is used to kill weeds (known best under the tradename Roundup) is an inhibitor of the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.19-RXN \"5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase\"| (EC 2.5.1.19), which catalyzes a reaction in the pathway (the condensation of |FRAME: SHIKIMATE-5P| and |FRAME: PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| to form |FRAME: 3-ENOLPYRUVYL-SHIKIMATE-5P|).

The organization and structure of the shikimate pathway enzymes varies between taxonomic groups |CITS: [2824247]|, with a differential distribution of fused genes. In most prokaryotes the seven shikimate pathway enzymes are encoded as separate polypeptides. The plant enzymes (which are nucleus encoded, but assumed to function within the plastid) are also encoded as separate polypeptides, with the exception of AroD and AroE that have fused to a single bifunctional polypeptide.
In contrast, all fungi, as well as the apicomplexan |FRAME: TAX-5811|, possess a pentafunctional supergene which includes conserved domains homologous to the genes (in fusion order) AroB, AroA, AroL/K, AroD, and AroE |CITS:[2825635][14711585]|.

In |FRAME: TAX-562|, the first reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by three separate enzymes, each of which is subject to feedback inhibition by one of the three amino acids that are synthesized from chorismate - |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|.
The enzyme subject to regulation by tryptophan (encoded by |FRAME: EG10080|) cannot be inhibited more than 60 percent, ensuring that sufficient enzymatic activity is present to permit synthesis of the other four metabolites synthesized from chorismate even in the presence of all three amino acids |CITS: [Pittard04]|."

In this pathway chorismate is synthesized from |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|. The pathway is found in prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea) and several eukaryotes, including ascomycete fungi, apicomplexans, plants and algae |CITS: [16963634]|. However, it's starting point, |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|, can be synthesized in different routes. In most microorganisms it is synthesized from |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| (see |FRAME: PWY-6164|), but the methanogens of the |FRAME: TAX-28890| phylum utilize an alternative route |CITS: [15182204]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6160|). 

|FRAME: CHORISMATE \"Chorismate\"| is an intermediate in the synthesis of the three aromatic amino acids: |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. These amino acids serve as substrates in other pathways for secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, lignin, coumarin, indole derivatives and other phenolic compounds |CITS: [22296303]|. 

|FRAME: SHIKIMATE \"Shikimate\"| is an important intermediate in the chorismate biosynthetic pathway. It was first isolated from Japanese star anise. Shikimate is used for the production of some antiviral drugs used to halt the spread of the flu virus, but as a biosynthetic intermediate, it is usually not found in high concentrations in organisms. Shikimate can be easily harvested from the needles of several species of pine trees, and biosynthetic pathways in |FRAME:TAX-562| have been enhanced to obtain sufficient amounts of the metabolite for commercial use.  

<b>About this Pathway</b>

The first enzyme in this section of the pathway, |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.10|, dehydrates |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE| to |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE|, which is subsequently reduced to |FRAME: SHIKIMATE| by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.25| (or in some organisms also by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.282|). The next enzyme, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.71|, was shown in |FRAME: TAX-1423| to form a complex with the bifunctional |FRAME: CPLX-1101| (|FRAME: G-279|). The complex may serve as a regulatory unit |CITS: [170268] [BSUB225]|.

|FRAME: EC-2.5.1.19|, catalyzes the penultimate step in chorismate biosynthesis. The synthase is activated by ammonium ions and exhibits allosteric behavior. |FRAME: CPD0-1308 Glyphosate| acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to |FRAME: PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| and as a partial uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to |FRAME: SHIKIMATE-5P| |CITS: [3111378] [7744055][7589547]|.

The last enzyme of the pathway, |FRAME: EC-4.2.3.5|, catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: 3-ENOLPYRUVYL-SHIKIMATE-5P| into |FRAME: CHORISMATE|, the key branch-point intermediate in aromatic biosynthesis."

|FRAME: BIOTIN \"Biotin\"| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> during carboxylation, decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|.
The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|,
|FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism
|CITS: [8676868]|.
Biotin may also have functions in metabolism other than its mere catalytic role as an enzyme cofactor. It has been shown that biotin also carries out non-catalytic functions in the expression of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase in |FRAME:TAX-3701| biotin-auxotroph mutants, by modulating and regulating gene expression |CITS: [12644697]|.

Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria and certain fungi. Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and development |CITS: [11322938]|. While the biotin biosynthetic pathway has been explored in detail only in bacteria, ongoing success in sequencing whole genomes from other organisms has provided evidence that the general steps in bacterial biotin synthesis are conserved in plants |CITS: [11322938]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years. The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [20693992]|.

Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, describe the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety in |FRAME: TAX-562|. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.

The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in |FRAME: TAX-562| are known from <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis of products labeled <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|. The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate. The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|. This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|. As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.

The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicated in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.
Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [13930373][Indrajit94]|. An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]|. Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 \"BioC\"| converts the free carboxyl group of a |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| thioester to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|.The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: CPD-12454| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.

Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters \"pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester\"|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 \"BioH\"| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs \"pimeloyl-[acp]\"|. According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway. When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.

It should be noted that many organisms that have a |FRAME: EG10119| gene do not have a homolog of the |FRAME: EG10122| gene. A remarkable diversity was found in the enzymes catalyzing this step, with different, non-related genes found in different organisms, including |FRAME: G-17965| from |FRAME: TAX-401614| |CITS: [23152908]|, |FRAME: G-15494| from |FRAME: TAX-93059| |CITS: [23152908]|, |FRAME: G-15495| from |FRAME: TAX-71421| |CITS: [24313380]|, and |FRAME: HP0287| from |FRAME: TAX-210| |CITS: [26868423]|.

The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 \"BioF\"|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly. An <i>in vitro</i> system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|."

in |CITS: [15581571]| and |CITS: [11567547]|.  L-Phenylalanine degradation shares this pathway after its initial hydroxylation to L-tyrosine (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PHENYLALANINE-DEG1-PWY|).  |FRAME: TAX-162425|
also degrades phenylacetate via 2-hydroxyphenylacetate to homogentisate using this pathway |CITS: [7673153]|.
The pathway ends in intermediates of central metabolism, as indicated by the pathway links.  Deficiencies of 
enzymes in this pathway have been associated with several human genetic disorders (as indicated in the 
comments for the individual enzymes in this pathway).  Homogentisate is a central intermediate.  In addition to being 
further catabolized, it can also be a biosynthetic precursor for melanins (in |CITS: [8071207]|), and is used by higher 
plants in the biosynthesis of plastoquinone and tocopherols (in |CITS: [15157070]| and reviewed 
in |CITS: [15581571]|) (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: PWY-1581| and |FRAME: PWY-1422|).   

This pathway does not occur in |FRAME:TAX-562| and |FRAME:TAX-590|, which cannot utilize L-tyrosine 
as a carbon and energy source (McFall, E. and Newman E. G. in |CITS: [COLISAL]|).  The pathway is also lacking in 
the yeast |FRAME:TAX-4932| which uses a limited number of carbon sources for growth, but 
can use most amino acids as sole nitrogen source (in |CITS: [15933030]|) (see MetaCyc pathways 
|FRAME: ANAPHENOXI-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5079|).      

A variation of this pathway has been reported in some Gram positive bacteria that can degrade L-tyrosine 
via 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate (homoprotocatechuate), rather than homogentisate, to pyruvate and 
succinate |CITS: [931949] [20216]|.  Another variation has been shown in the gram positive bacterium |FRAME:TAX-1817| 
sp. 239 which can degrade L-tyrosine to homogentisate via p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 
p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate.  D- and L-phenylalanine were similarly degraded 
by this organism via the corresponding non-hydroxylated compounds |CITS: [DEBOER88]|.  There is also 
evidence that the yeast |FRAME:TAX-4952| can degrade tyrosine to homogentisate through these 
intermediates |CITS: [11472920]|.  Among the archaea, however, there is little information regarding aromatic 
amino acid degradation, even in the well studied hyperthermophile |FRAME:TAX-2261| 
(in |CITS: [15803651]|), although a preliminary pathway has been proposed |CITS: [8206994]|."

and |FRAME:VAL|.
The catabolic pathways of the BCAAs can be divided into two sequential series of reactions, referred to
as the common pathway and the distal pathway.

The common pathway includes the enzymes |FRAME: CPLX-6941|, |FRAME: CPLX-6940|, and
|FRAME: CPLX-6942|. These three enzymes catalyze the conversion of all three BCAAs to their
respective acyl-CoA derivatives
(|FRAME:METHACRYLYL-COA|, |FRAME:3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA|, and |FRAME: CPD-1083|
for |FRAME:VAL|, |FRAME:LEU|, and |FRAME:ILE|, respectively), though the intermediates formed
by these enzymes are different for the different amino acids.
The distal parts of the pathways are completely different for the three BCAAs, and comprise enzymes
specific for each amino acid |CITS: [773366]|.

This Leucine degradation pathway is wide spread, and is found in microorganisms, higher plants, and
animals, including mammals.

The catabolism of |FRAME: LEU| begins with its transamination to |FRAME:2K-4CH3-PENTANOATE|,
followed by oxidative decarboxylation to |FRAME:ISOVALERYL-COA|.
|FRAME:ISOVALERYL-COA| then undergoes a four-step process, involving
dehydrogenation to |FRAME:3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA|, carboxylation to
|FRAME:TRANS-3-METHYL-GLUTACONYL-COA|, hydration to
|FRAME: 3-HYDROXY-3-METHYL-GLUTARYL-COA|, and finally a thioester hydrolysis
forming |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME:3-KETOBUTYRATE| |CITS: [4150714]|.
Leucine degradation is different from the degradation of the other branched-chain amino acids, in that it
includes a carboxylation step. The |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| fixing enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX66-17|,
requires a biotin cofactor.

In adipocytes, unlike other tissues, leucine is a significant precursor for fatty acid and sterol
biosynthesis, especially in the presence of glucose |CITS: [13892210]|.  Furthermore, leucine apparently
serves as a source of nitrogen for synthesis of |FRAME: GLN| and, to lesser extents, |FRAME: GLT|
and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, which are released by adipocytes |CITS: [6773935]| and can serve as
substrates for gluconeogenesis in liver and kidney |CITS: [6304077]|.

It should be mentioned that alternative leucine degradation pathways exist. In one such pathway, 
documented in |FRAME: TAX-1509|, leucine is degraded to |FRAME:ISOBUTYRATE| and
|FRAME: ACET| via |FRAME:CPD-2041| (see |FRAME:PWY-5075|).  Additional pathways which are currently not characterized very well include the conversion
of leucine to |FRAME: ACETONE| by members of the |FRAME:TAX-662| family |CITS: [10601206]|, and the
catabolism of leucine to branched-chain fatty acids in |FRAME: TAX-1288| |CITS: [15078537]|.

A portion of this leucine degradation pathway also participates in the final phase of the acyclic terpene utilization pathway, beginning at |FRAME: 3-METHYL-CROTONYL-COA| as shown in the pathway link from |FRAME: PWY-6672|.  The acyclic terpene utilization pathway includes pathways |FRAME: PWY-6670|, |FRAME: PWY-6672| and this pathway, with its associated pathway link to |FRAME: ACETOACETATE-DEG-PWY|.  In species of |FRAME:TAX-286| the enzymes of |FRAME: LEU|/|FRAME: ISOVALERATE| utilization are encoded in the <i>liuRABCDE</i> gene cluster (reviewed in |CITS: [20490788]|)."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=HISDEG-PWY"	"L-histidine degradation I"	"HISDEG-PWY"	"<b>General Background</b>

|FRAME: HIS| can be catabolized by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in two principal routes.
The main difference between these two routes is the first step, which is performed by either
a |FRAME: CPLX-6925| (as in this pathway) or a histidine transaminase (|FRAME: HISTDEG-PWY| and
|FRAME: PWY-5031|).

At least three different flavors of |FRAME: CPLX-6925|-based pathways have been found so far.
All proceed in a similar manner up to the intermediate |FRAME: N-FORMIMINO-L-GLUTAMATE|.
Three steps, catalyzed by distinct enzymes, lead to this intermediate.
In the first step |FRAME: HIS| is split into |FRAME: UROCANATE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| by
a |FRAME: CPLX-6925| |CITS: [14367318][12980948]|; Next |FRAME: UROCANATE|
is converted to |FRAME: 4-IMIDAZOLONE-5-PROPIONATE| by |FRAME: CPLX-981|
|CITS: [13587518][13821933]|; and finally, |FRAME: 4-IMIDAZOLONE-5-PROPIONATE| is converted to
|FRAME: N-FORMIMINO-L-GLUTAMATE| by |FRAME: HUTIBACSU-MONOMER| |CITS: [13587518]
[13739526]|.

In all three flavors |FRAME: N-FORMIMINO-L-GLUTAMATE| is further degraded to |FRAME: GLT|.
However, the mechanism of |FRAME: GLT| production is different in the three pathways.  
In several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-90371|,
|FRAME: TAX-573|, |FRAME: TAX-548| and |FRAME: TAX-1423|, |FRAME: N-FORMIMINO-L-GLUTAMATE|
is split into |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: FORMAMIDE| |CITS: [14367318]|; the latter compound
does not appear to be metabolized further (|FRAME: HISDEG-PWY|) |CITS: [13416179]|.  
In fluorescent Pseudomonads, including |FRAME: TAX-303|, |FRAME: TAX-294| and |FRAME: TAX-287|,
|FRAME: N-FORMIMINO-L-GLUTAMATE| is first hydrolyzed to |FRAME: AMMONIA| and 
|FRAME: CPD-600|, which in turn is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: FORMATE|
(|FRAME: PWY-5028|) |CITS: [13211593][4290562]|; the |FRAME: FORMATE| can serve as
a source of single carbon compounds |CITS: [13563517]|.   
Finally, in the livers of mammals |FRAME: GLT| is generated by the transfer of the formimino group to
|FRAME: THF| (|FRAME: PWY-5030|). |FRAME: THF| is metabolized further, transferring
the formyl moiety to the pool of single carbon compounds |CITS: [13672973]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Urocanic acid was first isolated in 1874 by the chemist M. Jaffe from the urine of a dog, hence the name
(latin: <i>urina</i> = urine, and |FRAME:TAX-9611| = dog) |CITS: [7944380]|.
Unfortunately the dog escaped before Jaffe was able identify the structure.
The identity and structure of the substance was eventually revealed in 1912 by Hunter, who was the first
to suggest that it is an intermediate in the catabolism of |FRAME: HIS| |CITS: [Hunter12]|.
Edlbacher identified  the locus of histidine degradation as the liver of various animals, and named the
enzyme that degrades |FRAME: HIS| to |FRAME: GLT| \"histidase\" |CITS: [Edlbacher26][Edlbacher30]|.
In 1930 Kauffmann and Mislowitzer defined histidase more correctly, as the enzyme that converts
|FRAME: HIS| to |FRAME: UROCANATE| |CITS: [Kauffmann30]|.
After a lengthy debate concerning the nature of the third intermediate, it was finally
shown conclusively that it is |FRAME:N-FORMIMINO-L-GLUTAMATE | by Borek and Waelsch
|CITS: [13117923]|. Finally, Revel and Magasanik discovered an additional intermediate, and
suggested that it is |FRAME:4-IMIDAZOLONE-5-PROPIONATE| |CITS: [13587518]|. This suggestion
was confirmed with the isolation of the substance |CITS: [13804907]|, thus establishing the pathway.

This pathway has been demonstrated in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,
including |FRAME: TAX-548| |CITS: [14367318]|, |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [4899017][4930059]|,
|FRAME: TAX-573| |CITS: [6321433]| and |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [Magasanik71]|.

The pathway is subject to a strong catabolite repression, preventing bacteria from using |FRAME: HIS|
as a nitrogen source if |FRAME: GLC| or |FRAME: SUC| are present in the growth medium
|CITS: [4990471]|. It is induced by |FRAME:UROCANATE|."

of the carbon skeleton of |FRAME:ARG| |CITS:[2865249][3129535]|. 
The pathway was detected in many Gram-negative proteobacteria able to utilize arginine as a
sole carbon and nitrogen source, including |FRAME: TAX-287|, |FRAME: TAX-303|, |FRAME: TAX-294|,
|FRAME: TAX-300|, |FRAME: TAX-333|, |FRAME: TAX-548|, |FRAME: TAX-292|, |FRAME: TAX-648|,
|FRAME: TAX-84158|, and |FRAME: TAX-45465| |CITS:[3534538]|. 
The pathway is also present in the enteric bacteria |FRAME: TAX-83333| and |FRAME: TAX-90371|, and it has been
shown to account for 97% of the total arginine degradation in |FRAME: TAX-83333| |CITS:[9696779]|. 
In most organisms the pathway coexists with other arginine dissimilation pathways, such as
the |FRAME: ARGDEG-III-PWY| and the |FRAME:ARGDEGRAD-PWY|, which provide different purposes
(e.g. polyamine production and energy generation).  However, in some organisms, such as
|FRAME: TAX-292|, the arginine succinyltransferase pathway is the only arginine catabolic pathway. 
In |FRAME: TAX-287| this is the major arginine utilization pathway under aerobic conditions
|CITS:[9393691]|.

The enzyme arginine succinyltransferase, which catalyzes the succinylation of |FRAME:ARG|,
also catalyzes the succinylation of |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| to |FRAME:N2-SUCCINYLORNITHINE|,
which is another intermediate of this pathway.  Thus, the routes for the degradation of both |FRAME:ARG|
and |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| converge at |FRAME:N2-SUCCINYLORNITHINE| |CITS:[3144259][7523119]|.

The <i>aru</i> genes encoding all of the proteins of this pathway have been cloned from
|FRAME: TAX-287| and sequenced.  They all belong to a single operon, controlled by the ArgR regulatory protein
|CITS:[9393691]|.

This pathway is also the only arginine-degrading pathway found in |FRAME:TAX-562|.  This pathway, which
yields 2 molecules of |FRAME: AMMONIA| and 2 of |FRAME: GLT|, can satisfy |FRAME:TAX-562|'s total nitrogen
requirement, but not its total carbon requirement.  It does, however, permit other organisms, for
example |FRAME: TAX-548| to utilize |FRAME: ARG| as a total source of carbon.  With the exception of the
third enzyme in the pathway, succinylornithine transaminase (encoded by <i>astC</i>), enzymes of this pathway
from |FRAME:TAX-562| have not been characterized beyond assaying crude extracts.  Succinylornithine transaminase
gained special attention and was originally designated as <i>argM</i> because is can substitute for acetylornithine
transaminase (encoded by <i>argD</i>) in the biosynthesis of arginine.  The substrates of the two enzymes differ
only in |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| being acetylated in the biosynthetic pathway and succinylated in the degradative
pathway.  Reviewed in Reitzer, L. (2005) \"Catabolism of Amino Acids and Related Compounds.\"  EcoSal

to regulation by all three amino acids. The first step in the pathway is primarily
inhibited by valine, along with inhibition by isoleucine and leucine.
The potential disruption this might cause to the parallel

upregulation of an earlier step that is unique to isoleucine biosynthesis, as explained

In addition, hyperthermophilic organisms usually have an additional gene, trpB2, which is located outside of the

While the amino acid |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| is not involved
directly in protein synthesis, it is an important intermediate in many metabolic pathways, such as
the |FRAME:PWY-4984| and the biosynthesis of several compounds, including arginine
(see |FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY| and |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), proline (see |FRAME:PWY-3341|
and |FRAME:PWY-4981|), and putrescine (|FRAME:PWY-46|), which leads to the biosynthesis of other
polyamines and pyrimidines.  It is also involved in |FRAME: PWY-6818|.

This pathway documents the synthesis of |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| from |FRAME:GLT| via
<i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the
spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis (see
|FRAME:PROSYN-PWY|), thus keeping the pathways leading to arginine and proline separate
(|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein). 

Two alternative pathways have evolved, which differ in the way the key intermediate
|FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed, and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another
intermediate, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|.
In this pathway, which is less common, NAG is formed by NAG synthase, and
|FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase,
forming |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| and |FRAME: ACET|.
In the other pathway (see |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and
eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is
removed from |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto |FRAME: GLT|, regenerating
|FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG). 

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This ornithine biosynthesis pathway has been found in the |FRAME:TAX-543|
|FRAME: TAX-83333| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [3534538]|,
the |FRAME: TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-34|
|CITS: [ 9829957]|, and the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2287| |CITS: [vandecasteele90]|.
In it |FRAME: GLT| is acetylated to NAG by the enzyme
|FRAME:N-ACETYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10063| gene.
The acetyl donor for this reaction is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|. 
NAG is then converted in several enzymatic steps to |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|.
The acetyl group is removed in the form of |FRAME: ACET| by the enzyme
|FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX|, encoded by the |FRAME:EG11286| gene, resulting in
|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|."

Six pathways are now recognized in bacteria, most algae, fungi and higher plants for the biosynthesis of lysine. They are divided into two groups - the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways, and the |FRAME:CPD-468| pathways.

In the pathways that belong to the DAP group, lysine is produced from aspartate (along with methionine, threonine and isoleucine). All of the DAP group pathways share the upper segments, which include the four steps required for conversion of  L-aspartate to |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE|. They also share the last step, which is the conversion of the intermediate |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| (D,L-DAP, or <i>meso</i>-DAP) to lysine.
However, these pathways differ in the routes leading from |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|. The four variations include:

(I) the succinylase variant (see |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|), which involves succinylated intermediates. In this route |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is coverted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in four enzymatic steps.

(II) the acetylase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-2941|), which involves acetylated intermediates. This route also involves four enzymatic steps for the conversion of |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|.

(III) the dehydrogenase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-2942|), in which |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in a single enzymatic step. 

(IV) the diaminopimelate-aminotransferase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-5097|), in which |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in two steps.

In addition to lysine, all of the pathways in this group also produce |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is an important metabolite on its own (for example, as a constituent of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan).

The two other pathways belong to the |FRAME: CPD-468| group. They are found in organisms that have no requirement for |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, as it is not a component of their cell walls. These pathways also share the first segments, leading to the synthesis of the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-468| (&alpha;-aminoadipate).
However, in yeast and fungi, as well as  |FRAME: TAX-3038|, the pathway continues with the key enzyme |FRAME: YBR115C-MONOMER|, leading to the intermediate |FRAME: SACCHAROPINE| (see |FRAME: LYSINE-AMINOAD-PWY|), while in prokaryotes the pathway continues in a path similar to bacterial arginine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-3081|).

Most of the bacteria that have been investigated in detail appear to utilize only one of these pathways |CITS: [1906065]|. A few exceptions include |FRAME: TAX-44252|, in which variants (II) and (III) seem to coexist |CITS: [BARTLETT85]|, and |FRAME: TAX-1718|, in which variant (I) and (III) coexist |CITS: [1906065]|.

Lysine is one of the 10 essential amino acids that mammals are unable to synthesize, and must therefore acquire in their diets.  

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Some Gram-positive bacteria, including |FRAME:TAX-1718|, <i>Brevibacterium
lactofermentum</i> and |FRAME:TAX-1421|, can convert tetrahydrodipicolinate to
<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate in a single enzymatic step, catalyzed by the enzyme diaminopimelate dehydrogenase.
In some organisms, such as <i>B. sphaericus</i>,  this is the only lysine biosynthesis pathway |CITS: [White83]|, 
while in others, such as <i>C. glutamicum</i>, it exists in parallel with alternative pathways.

Even though the conversion of tetrahydrodipicolinate to <i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate
involves a single enzymatic step, the full reaction is composed of two steps. In the first step, which is presumably
spontaneous, tetrahydrodipicolinate loses a water molecule, and opens to its acyclic form,
L-&alpha;-amino-&epsilon;-keto-pimelate. The second step is the enzymatic conversion to
<i>meso</i>-DAP |CITS: [762012]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Lysine biosynthesis in plants was thought to be identical to the prokaryotic DAP (diaminopimelate) pathway that uses N-succinylated intermediates (|FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|) |CITS: [15652176]|. However the Arabidopsis genome does not contain a homolog of |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.117|. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis homologs of |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.17|, and |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.18|, are not likely to function in lysine biosynthesis |CITS: [15652176]|. It was thus suggested that plants may synthesize lysine via an enzyme that bypasses the three reactions by directly converting tetrahydrodipicolinate to L,L-diaminopimelate. An Arabidopsis enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, |FRAME: AT4G33680-MONOMER|, was indeed discovered |CITS: [16361515]|. Despite the fact that the forward reaction (towards lysine biosynthesis) seems to be unfavorable, the enzyme was shown to be involved in lysine biosynthesis under physiological conditions by functional complementation of an |FRAME: TAX-562| lysine biosynthesis double mutant of dapD and dapE.

The key enzyme, |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.83|, was discovered not only in green plants, but also in bacteria belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-1117| and |FRAME: TAX-1783257| |CITS: [17093042]|, and in archeaebacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-183925| and the |FRAME: TAX-183939| classes |CITS: [18371309][20418392]|. Soon after it was reported that a diverged form of the enzyme is also common in many other bacterial phyla |CITS: [18310350]|. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that two lateral gene transfers occurred in the DapL genes, one from archaea to  bacteria, forming  the DapL2 group, and one from bacteria to archaea, forming the DapL1 group |CITS: [20418392]|.

The first committed enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: EC-4.3.3.7|, is feedback regulated by lysine |CITS: [8000011]|. Its catalyzed reaction is the rate-limiting step for lysine biosynthesis. |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.83|, may impose another regulation point of lysine biosynthesis - using maize cultured embryo cells, it was shown that the overall rate of lysine synthesis is in the same range of the forward reaction catalyzed by this enzyme |CITS: [16361515]|.

Lysine biosynthesis in plants occurs within chloroplasts. No evidence exists for extra plastidic location of the pathway |CITS: [15652176]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The succinylase variant is the most common bacterial lysine biosynthesis pathway. It is found in many
different types of bacteria.
In this pathway, a succinate moiety is added to |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE|,
followed by an amino group, to form <i>N</i>-succinyl-L,L-DAP.

|FRAME: ILE| is almost always synthesized from |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|. In the most common pathway,  |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| is generated from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| via |FRAME: THR| (see |FRAME:PWY-3001|). The key enzyme in that pathway is |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10493| gene.

In addition to the standard pathway, microorganisms have developed several alternative pathways for |FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis. |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| can be synthesized from |FRAME: GLT| via |FRAME: L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5103|) |CITS: [4550817]|, from |FRAME: PYRUVATE| (this pathway) |CITS: [4607875][4808901][15292141]|, and from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| by carboxylation (see |FRAME: PWY-5104|) |CITS: [5800441][1212197][Eikmanns83a]|). In addition, there are several reports that under anaerobic conditions some anaerobic bacteria can carboxylate |FRAME: CPD-7076| to |FRAME: ILE| via |FRAME: 2-KETO-3-METHYL-VALERATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5108|) |CITS: [5813342][6726176][6440485 ]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway desribed here was originally proposed in the spirochaete |FRAME: TAX-173| in 1974 |CITS: [4808901]|. Using isotope labeling data, it was shown that the pathway, which was named \"the pyruvate pathway\", started with the condensation of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE| to form citramalate. At the time it wasn't clear whether the product of this initial reaction is |FRAME: CPD-31| or its stereoisomer, |FRAME:S-CITRAMALATE|. As a result, two plausible routes were proposed, depending on the stereoisomer formed. The route starting with |FRAME:S-CITRAMALATE| would proceed via |FRAME:L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE|, while the route starting with |FRAME: CPD-31| would proceed in a manner very similar to the pathway of |FRAME:LEUSYN-PWY|. Both routes were proposed to combine at |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|, the key intermediate which is formed directly from |FRAME: THR| in the more common |FRAME: ILE| biosynthetic pathway (|FRAME:ILEUSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [4808901]|.

Subsequent work has confirmed the presence of the pyruvate pathway in other |FRAME:TAX-171| strains |CITS: [6404889]| as well as in many species of archaea |CITS: [Eikmanns83][Ekiel84]|, but did not determine the exact route employed by the organisms. In 1999 an |FRAME: CPLX-7022| was purified from |FRAME: TAX-2190|, and shown to catalyze the formation of |FRAME: CPD-31| |CITS: [9864346]|. In 2004 a similar enzyme was isolated from |FRAME: TAX-189518|. These authors were also able to show that |FRAME: 2-METHYLMALEATE| is the substrate for the following reaction. By cloning and overexpressing the enzymes |FRAME:CPLX-7020 | and |FRAME: CPLX-7021|, which catalyze the comparable steps in |FRAME: LEU| biosynthesis (see |FRAME: LEUSYN-PWY|), the authors were able to demonstrate the conversion of |FRAME: 2-METHYLMALEATE| to |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|, confirming that this is indeed the route
employed by |FRAME:TAX-171| strains for |FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis. Despite the sharing of several enzymes between the biosynthetic pathways of |FRAME: LEU| and |FRAME: ILE| in these organisms, these pathways are not co-regulated, due to the difference in the enzymes catalyzing the first reaction. |FRAME:CPLX-7019| expression is not regulated by |FRAME: LEU|, but is sensitive to |FRAME: ILE| concentrations |CITS: [15292141]|.

Even though the pathway has not been characterized as well in archaebacteria, the presence and nature of several key enzymes from |FRAME: TAX-2190| suggests that this is most likely the |FRAME: ILE| biosynthestic pathway employed by methanogens |CITS: [15292141][17449626]|. The pathway has been subsequently detected in non-methanogenic archaea |CITS: [17400748]| as well as in the Delta-proteobacterium |FRAME: TAX-35554| |CITS: [18245290]|. The CimA protein from |FRAME: TAX-35554| constituted the first characterized member of a phylogenetically distinct clade of citramalate synthases. Based on the distribution of homologs of that protein, the pathway has been predicted to have a much wider occurrence than previously thought, and may exist in Delta-proteobacteria, Alpha-proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deinococci, Clostridia, Actinobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Chlorobia, and the Chloroflex, as well as the |FRAME: TAX-183968| class of the archaea |CITS: [18245290]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=ILEUSYN-PWY"	"L-isoleucine biosynthesis I (from threonine)"	"ILEUSYN-PWY"	"The pathway of |FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis from |FRAME: THR| is a five-step pathway that shares its last four steps with the pathway of |FRAME: VAL| biosynthesis. These entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates not only |FRAME: ILE| and |FRAME: VAL|, but also |FRAME: LEU|.

As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject to regulation by all three amino acids. The first enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|, is downregulated by isoleucine and leucine, but is upregulated by valine. The following pathway step, catalyzed by |FRAME: ACETOLACTSYNI-CPLX| (AHAS I) and |FRAME: ACETOLACTSYNIII-CPLX| (AHAS III), is inhibited by all three amino acids. This apparent paradox of valine stimulation of step one followed by valine inhibition of step two is a product of the preference of AHAS III for processing of the isoleucine precursor |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| rather than the valine precursor |FRAME: PYRUVATE|. When valine is abundant in the cell, both AHAS
enzymes are inhibited, blocking valine production and potentially disrupting isoleucine synthesis as well. However, the stimulation of |FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX| generates a substantial pool of |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|. Combined with the high affinity of AHAS III for this compound, this allows the isoleucine synthesis to continue despite inhibition caused by the parallel valine synthesis pathway.

Enteric bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-511145| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| have been shown to possess two types of threonine dehydratases - a catabolic enzyme, which is induced by threonine (see |FRAME: THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX|), and a consistitutively-produced biosynthetic enzyme (|FRAME: THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|. Both enzymes convert threonine to |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|, but differ in their regulation and expression.

Biosynthetic threonine dehydratases were also described in several soil bacteria |CITS: [16743051]|. A survey of 75 soil isolates capable of growth on L-threonine revealed a group of three organisms that possessed substantial L-threonine dehydratase activity, to the exclusion of any other threonine-catabolyzing enzyme |CITS: [5076220]|.  The group consisted of |FRAME:ORG-5895| and two |FRAME:TAX-1696| isolates. The enzyme from |FRAME:ORG-5895| was partially purified, and was found to be of the biosynthetic type on the criteria that its formation was consitutive, it was susceptible to inhibition by |FRAME:ILE|, |FRAME:VAL| protected against denaturation and was a positive effector and antagonist of isoleucine, and neither AMP nor ADP acted as effectors |CITS: [16743051]|. Interestingly, even though the enzyme was of the biosynthetic type, the researchers found that much of the threonine in these organisms was converted to |FRAME:PROPIONATE| in a catabolic pathway identical to that described in |FRAME:PWY-5437|. Thus, the biosynthetic enzyme was recruited to a catabolic pathway.

A biosynthetic threonine dehydratase was also reported in |FRAME:TAX-615| |CITS: [355220]|."

|FRAME: ILE| is almost always synthesized from |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|. In the most
common pathway,  |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| is generated from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| via
|FRAME: THR| (see |FRAME:PWY-3001|).
The key enzyme in that pathway is |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10493| gene.

In addition to the standard pathway, microorganisms have developed several alternative pathways for
|FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis. |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| can be synthesized from |FRAME: GLT| via |FRAME: L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE| (this pathway) |CITS: [4550817]|, from |FRAME: PYRUVATE| (see |FRAME:PWY-5101|) |CITS: [4607875][4808901][15292141]|, and from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| by carboxylation (see |FRAME: PWY-5104|) |CITS: [5800441][1212197][Eikmanns83a]|).
In addition, there are several reports that under anaerobic conditions some anaerobic bacteria can carboxylate
|FRAME: CPD-7076| to |FRAME: ILE| via |FRAME: 2-KETO-3-METHYL-VALERATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5108|) |CITS: [5813342][6726176][6440485]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway was first described in 1962 by Abramsky et al, who observed that in |FRAME: TAX-566546|
|FRAME:L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE| was exclusively converted to |FRAME: ILE| |CITS: [13859068]|.
The authors suggested a pathway in which |FRAME: L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE| is transaminated to
|FRAME: METHYLOXALO-ACETATE| (based on earlier reports by |CITS: [13766613]|), followed by decarboxylation
to  |FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|, which is then used for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ILE| in the
\"conventional\" manner.  The proposed pathway was substantiated by a second paper published
by the same group  |CITS: [14342322]|. However, the biological significance of this pathway was not clear,
as it was not known whether |FRAME:L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE| occurs naturally in |FRAME: TAX-566546|.

In 1972 Phillips et al have demonstrated that a different strain of |FRAME:TAX-562| (|FRAME: ORG-5900|, ATCC 8739)
was able to synthesize |FRAME: ILE| from |FRAME: GLT|. The authors were able to demonstrate activity
in crude extracts of several enzymes, including the key enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-7027|, which converts |FRAME:GLT|
to |FRAME:L-THREO-3-METHYL-ASPARTATE|, as well as |FRAME: MONOMER-11907| |CITS: [4550817]|.

Please note that the last 4 steps in this pathway are identical to the \"common\" |FRAME: ILE| biosynthetic pathway.
For information about |FRAME: TAX-83333| enzymes catalyzing these steps, see the pathway |FRAME:PWY-3001|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This pathway was first suggested by Buchanan, who in 1969 discovered the key enzyme,
|FRAME: CPLX-7028|, in cell extracts from the photosynthetic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1047|
|CITS: [5800441]|.
This enzyme catalyzes a ferredoxin-dependent reductive carboxylation of |FRAME: PROPIONYL-COA| to
|FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE|. Buchanan found that at least in |FRAME: TAX-1047| the resulting
|FRAME: 2-OXOBUTANOATE| is processed to |FRAME: ILE| by enzymes involved in the \"common\"
|FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis pathway. He was also able to show the same enzymatic activity in the non-photosynthetic
bacteria |FRAME: TAX-1501| and |FRAME: TAX-876| |CITS: [5800441]|.
An independent report of the pathway in another |FRAME:TAX-1485| sp., |FRAME: TAX-1509|, has also
been published |CITS: [6726176]|.

A few years later Sauer et al published a report that documented the incorporation of labeled
|FRAME:PROPIONATE| into |FRAME:ILE| by mixed cultures of rumen microorganisms |CITS:[1212197]|.
These authors also found that the |FRAME:PROPIONATE| was converted to |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE |
by reductive carboxylation.

A third study supporting this pathway was published in 1983 by Eikmanns et al |CITS: [Eikmanns83a]|. This study
reported that several methanogenic archaea, including |FRAME: TAX-145262|, |FRAME: TAX-39441| and |FRAME: TAX-2208|,
incorporated assimilated |FRAME:PROPIONATE| almost exclusively into |FRAME: ILE|. The process was inhibited
by several |FRAME: ILE| biosynthesis intermediates, including |FRAME:CPD-7076|, |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|
and |FRAME: ILE|.

and archaea. The pathway in all of these organisms is identical, with small differences in some of
the enzymes used. Histidine is an essential amino acid, and is not synthesized by mammals.

A few differences between different organisms concern whether the enzymes are mono- or bifunctional. One such case is the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.15|. Some organisms, including  |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: TAX-90371| and |FRAME: TAX-727|, have a bifunctional enzyme, with the C-terminal domain exhibiting |FRAME:IMIDPHOSDEHYD-ENZRXN| (EC 4.2.1.19) activity. These enzymes belong to the DDDD phosphohydrolase/phosphotransferase superfamily. Other organisms have separate monofunctional enzymes catalyzing these two reactions. Monofunctional histidinol-phosphate phosphatases belong to either the PHP (polymerase and histidinol phosphatase) superfamily, as in the case of |FRAME: TAX-1423|, |FRAME: TAX-4932| and |FRAME: TAX-300852| |CITS: [14993698]|, or to the DDDD superfamily, as in the case of the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-342948| NA1 |CITS: [18223080]|.

Another such case concerns the conversion of |FRAME:PHOSPHORIBULOSYL-FORMIMINO-AICAR-P| (BBM III) to |FRAME:D-ERYTHRO-IMIDAZOLE-GLYCEROL-P| (IGP) and |FRAME:AICAR| (AICAR), which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-4.3.2.10|. This process requires two catalytic functions, including the transfer of an amide from |FRAME: GLN| and a cyclization reaction. In prokaryotes, these two catalytic activities are encoded by two genes whose products form a complex. In yeast and plants, this conversion is catalyzed by a single bifunctional enzyme.

In all organisms operating the pathway, the enzyme catalyzing the first step is feedback-inhibited  by |FRAME: HIS|. In plants, the entire pathway is located inside the chloroplast |CITS: [16547652]|."

Rather, it is assembled from a variety of organisms.  Its purpose is to provide an overview of the ways
that organisms can biosynthesize glutamate and glutamine.

The amino acid glutamate is a both constituent of proteins and a biosynthetic precursor. Many 
pathways and reactions involving glutamate as a precursor are shown on the MetaCyc compound page 
for |FRAME: GLT|.  Glutamine is also a constituent of proteins and is the amino group donor for many
biosynthetic reactions, as shown on the MetaCyc compound page for |FRAME: GLN|.
It also serves as a storage form of ammonia.    

In microorganisms, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate synthase
(glutamine &alpha;-oxoglutarate amidotransferase, GOGAT) are used for ammonia assimilation.
Some of these organisms may use only glutamate dehydrogenase, or only glutamine
synthetase/glutamate synthase (GS/GOGAT), while others use either route, depending upon growth
conditions (|CITS: [GOTTSCHALK1986]| and in |CITS: [17020556] [14555464]|).
Mammals use glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase in nitrogen metabolism.
In plants, GS/GOGAT functions in ammonia assimilation.  A role for glutamate dehydrogenase in
glutamate biosynthesis in plants is unclear |CITS: [17114271]|.

Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate |CITS: [12633501]|. A variation of the pathway found in some archaebacteria and hyperthermophilic bacteria utilizes a dedicated carrier protein to protect the intermediates instead of acetylation.

Several alternative arginine biosynthetic pathways have evolved in bacteria:

In |FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY|, which is not very common, the key intermediate |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.1|. A second key intermediate downstream, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|, is hydrolyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.16|, releasing acetate, and forming the arginine precursor |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|.

In |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions mentioned above are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto glutamate, regenerating  |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG).
This recycling is performed by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.35|. This pathway is considered more evolved, since the overall reaction is energetically more favorable |CITS: [3534538]|.

The variant |FRAME: PWY-5154| is found in several eubacteria. While in the two pathways mentioned above |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is deacetylate to |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, which is subsequntly transcarbamoylated to form |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE|, in this variant |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is not deacetylated. Instead, it is
transcarbamoylated directly by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.1.3.9|, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-7224|. The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX| can accept |FRAME: CPD-7224| as a substrate, and deacetylates it into |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| |CITS: [16585758]|.

The variant |FRAME: PWY-7400|, which has been described in the archaebacterium |FRAME: TAX-2285|, involves early intermediates that are protected not by acetylation but by a carrier protein (the LysW |FRAME: LysW|), which participates in the biosynthesis of both |FRAME: ARG| and |FRAME: LEU| in these organsims |CITS: [23434852]|.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The cyclic pathway for arginine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in many organisms, including the prokaryotes |FRAME:TAX-186817|, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and archaebacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms such as |FRAME:TAX-4932|, |FRAME:TAX-5140| sp., and |FRAME:TAX-3052| sp.

Organisms that employ this pathway possess the <i>argJ</i> gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). OAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from <i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-ornithine to glutamate,  generating ornithine and <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). Since the latter is the substrate for another enzyme in this pathway, <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate kinase (encoded by <i>argB</i>), which catalyzes a previous step, this reaction effectively converts the otherwise linear pathway to a cyclical pathway  |CITS: [JGM138-125][8025667]|.
While most of the NAG in these organisms is generated by OAT, some of it is still generated by <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1, encoded by <i>argA</i>), which fulfils an anaplerotic (replenishment of pathway intermediates) role to replenish NAG that is lost due to degradation or cell division |CITS: [12633501]|.

In some bacteria, such as <i>Bacillus</i> sp. |CITS: [8473852 ]|, <i>Nisseria gonorrhoeae</i> |CITS: [1339419]|, |FRAME:TAX-2337| |CITS: [10931207]| and in yeast (|FRAME:TAX-4932|) |CITS: [9428669]|, OAT can have a dual enzymic function. In these organisms, either <i>N</i>-acetylornithine or acetyl-CoA can be used as acetyl donors for formation of NAG.  <i>argJ</i> genes from such organisms can complement both <i>argE</i> and <i>argA</i> mutations in |FRAME:TAX-562|. However, these organisms still possess separate NAGS enzymes encoded by <i>argA</i> genes. The biological role of duplicate NAGS activity in these organisms remains to be elucidated |CITS: [12633501]|.

<b>Additional yeast-specific info from the |FRAME:TAX-4930| Genome Database:</b>

The first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> take place in the mitochondrion
|CITS: [11553611][Hinnebusch]|. This part of the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the
acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate
generated in the fifth step.
The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated
into a pre-protein which is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate
kinase and <i>N</i>-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase |CITS: [1649049]|.
These enzymes form a complex with each other and with <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme in the
pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity |CITS: [11553611]|.
The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result in the formation of ornithine, which is exported
to the cytoplasm by the transporter Ort1p |CITS: [8798783]|. In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to
L-arginine in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase, and
argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, as well as of other amino
acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid
starvation |CITS: [11390663][Hinnebusch]|. Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also
repressed in the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p,
and Mcm1p |CITS: [14563547]|. The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p
repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional control in response to arginine availability |CITS: [15289616]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The linear pathway of arginine biosynthesis has been described in several organisms including the <i>Enterobacteriaceae |CITS: [3534538]|</i>, the |FRAME:TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, and the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME:TAX-34|
|CITS: [ 9829957]|. The pathway in these organisms starts with the acetylation of the amino moiety of |FRAME: GLT|
catalyzed by ArgA, ArgJ or both, yielding |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG).

Some archaeal species, such as |FRAME: TAX-2284|, which are known to produce |FRAME: ARG|, do not have either ArgA and ArgJ orthologs. Instead, these organisms use the |FRAME: G-17812|-encoded ligase to bind |FRAME: GLT| to a dedicated |FRAME: LysW \"carrier protein\"| encoded by the <i>lysW</i> gene. The carrier protein, as well as the next 4 enzymes in the pathway, are bifunctional and participate in both |FRAME: ARG| and |FRAME: LEU| biosynthesis in these organisms (see |FRAME: PWY-3081|).

The C-terminal part of the carrier protein is acidic and is easily recognized by the subsequent enzymes, all of which have a basic environment around their active sites. In this way the subsequent transformations leading to |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| occur while the amino acid is attached to LysW |CITS: [19620981]|. Once formed, the ornithine is removed from the carrier protein by a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-17816| gene |CITS: [23434852]|."

<b>About This Pathway</b>

This linear variant of the arginine biosynthesis pathway has been reported from the <i>Enterobacteriaceae |CITS: [3534538]|</i>, the |FRAME:TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, and the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME:TAX-34| |CITS: [ 9829957]|. The pathway was also described in the archaeon |FRAME:TAX-2287| |CITS: [vandecasteele90]|, but in most likelihood that organism possesses a different variant of the pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7400|).

In this pathway  glutamate is acetylated to <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate (NAG) by the enzyme NAG synthase, encoded by the <i>argA</i> gene. The acetyl donor for this reaction is  acetyl-CoA. NAG is then converted in several enzymatic steps to <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine. The acetyl group is removed in the form of acetate by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, encoded by the <i>argE</i> gene. Ornithine is then combined with carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline, which is converted in two steps to L-arginine."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-1061"	"superpathway of L-alanine biosynthesis"	"PWY0-1061"	"|FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| is an essential component of protein and peptidoglycan. The later also contains about three molecules of D-alanine  for every L-alanine. Only about 10 percent of the total alanine synthesized flows into peptidoglycan.

At least three pathways (|FRAME: ALANINE-VALINESYN-PWY|, |FRAME: ALANINE-SYN2-PWY|, and |FRAME: PWY0-1021|) contribute to the synthesis of alanine. Alanine biosynthesis I is established only by existence of the relevant enzymes. Its contribution to alanine synthesis remains speculative because alanine auxotrophs have not yet been isolated. Because alanine but not valine represses AvtA, its primary purpose is probably synthesis of L-alanine |CITS: [396446]||CITS: [7040341]|. Existence of the Alanine biosyntheis II  pathways rests on the evidence that lutamate-pyruvate 
aminotransferase acitivity is found in crude cell extracts; the enzymes has not been purified nor have mutant alleles of its designated encoding gene (alaB) been isolated  |CITS: [396446]|, |CITS: [4146872]|.  The conversion can also be mediated as a side reaction of alanine racemase |CITS: [9832621]| . The alanine biosyntheis III pathway, mediated by cysteine desulfurase activity  is required to donate sulfane sulfur for the synthesis of Fe-S clusters, thiamine, thionucleosides in tRNAs, biotin, lipoic acid, and molybdopterin |CITS: [12382038]| probably contributes only a minor amount of the cell's alanine requirement, as judged by the cell's total requirement for sulfane sulfur.

This pathway is regulated at multiple points by its end product, both via enzyme inhibition and attenuation. Attenuation in response to |FRAME: ILE| and |FRAME: THR| represses the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth steps in this pathway. In addition, the enzymatic activity of |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.3| is inhibited by |FRAME: THR|, regulating flux through the second and fourth steps in the pathway.

In |FRAME: TAX-562| three enzymes carry out the second step and two enzymes carry out the fourth step, reflecting the many downstream products that depend on those reaction steps.

More thoroughg regulatory relationships affecting these pathway steps is provided in |FRAME: P4-PWY|."

|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE \"Thiamine diphosphate\"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX \"pyruvate dehydrogenase\"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 \"pyruvate decarboxylase\"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 \"&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase\"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamine-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
Thiamine is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways thart enable them to rescue thiamine fragments obtained from the environment. This pathway describes the salvage of two thiamine-degradation compounds, |FRAME: THZ| and |FRAME: HMP| (HMP).

The key enzyme of the pathway is |FRAME: CPLX-8351| (|FRAME: BSU38300|), an enzyme  that phosphorylates the degradation product |FRAME: THZ|, turning it into the phosphorylated form that it a part of the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway.

HMP is processed by |FRAME: BSU11710-MONOMER| (|FRAME: BSU11710|), a bifunctional enzyme that also takes part in the biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme phosphorylates HMP into |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P|, already an intermediate of the biosynthetic pathway, and continues to add another phosphate, resulting in |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, the other substrate of |FRAME: BSU38290-MONOMER|.

The rest of the pathway is identical to the biosynthetic pathway: |FRAME: BSU38290-MONOMER| catalyzes the coupling of the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties, while |FRAME: BSU05900-MONOMER| adds another phosphate group, generating the active form |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|."

|FRAME: TOLUENE Toluene| is widely used as an industrial additive and solvent. Toluene and related aromatic compounds can be degraded by bacteria, and have been studied in the metabolically versatile genus |FRAME:TAX-286| and closely related genera. These studies have been directed toward bioremediation of environmental pollutants by metabolic engineering, and the development of syntrophic bacterial consortia  (reviewed in |CITS: [15492931]|). Aerobic pathways of toluene degradation have been identified in various species that involve different initial monooxygenase, or hydroxylating dioxygenase reactions. Several of these pathways converge in the formation of |FRAME: CPD-111| (2,3-dihydroxytoluenel) |CITS: [1892384]|. This compound is a substrate for ring cleavage enzymes, the products of which are metabolized via a common <i>meta</i> fission pathway, resulting in the formation of compounds of central metabolism (see this pathway and MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: TOLUENE-DEG-3-OH-PWY| and |FRAME: TOLUENE-DEG-DIOL-PWY|).   

<b>About This Pathway</b>

A degradative plasmid, TOM, containing an operon for the inducible toluene <i>ortho</i>-monooxygenase pathway has been identified in |FRAME: TAX-292| G4. The operon, <i>tomA012345</i>, encodes toluene <i>ortho</i>-monooxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which allow this organism to grow on toluene and related compounds as sole carbon and energy source |CITS: [7538275]|, and in |CITS: [11751810]|. This pathway for toluene degradation via |FRAME: CPD-111| in |FRAME: TAX-292| (previously known as <i>Pseudomonas cepacia</i>) is shown here.

In this pathway, toluene is sequentially hydroxylated by the |FRAME: CPLX-6483| system. The first hydroxylation is at the <i>ortho</i> position yielding |FRAME: CPD-109| (2-hydroxytoluene) as an intermediate, and the second is at the <i>meta</i> position yielding |FRAME: CPD-111| |CITS: [7578004]|.  

Ring fission of |FRAME: CPD-111| is catalyzed by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase to produce |FRAME: 2H6OH2-4DIENOATE|. This compound is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: OXOPENTENOATE|, or its tautomeric dienol form |FRAME: CPD-6761|. This tautomerization occurs spontaneously in aqueous solution |CITS: [15301547]|. It is not known which tautomeric form is produced by the hydrolase, and which form is used by the hydratase of |FRAME: TAX-292|. However, it has been suggested that the |FRAME:TAX-303| hydratase uses the dienol form as a substrate |CITS: [2681159]|, and there is evidence that the |FRAME:TAX-562| hydratase also uses the dienol form as substrate, producing a ketonized intermediate in the reaction mechanism |CITS: [9492273]|.

The enzymes catalyzing the last three reactions in this pathway, as well as the intermediates, were not directly demonstrated in |FRAME: TAX-292|. However, their existence in this organism is inferred by work in <i>Pseudomonas</i> |CITS: [8063106]|. The products of the pathway are pyruvate, which enters central metabolism, and acetaldehyde, which may be converted by acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA, a central metabolite |CITS: [8063106][8419288]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-5182"	"toluene degradation II (aerobic) (via 4-methylcatechol)"	"PWY-5182"	"Toluene is widely used as an industrial additive and solvent. Toluene and related aromatic compounds can be degraded by bacteria, and have been studied in the metabolically versatile genus |FRAME:TAX-286| and closely related genera.  These studies have been directed toward bioremediation of environmental pollutants by metabolic engineering, and the development of syntrophic bacterial consortia  (reviewed in |CITS: [15492931]|).  Aerobic pathways of toluene degradation have been identified in various species that involve different initial monooxygenase, or hydroxylating dioxygenase reactions.  Several of these pathways converge in the formation of 2,3-dihydroxytoluene (3-methylcatechol) |CITS: [1892384]|.  This compound is a substrate for ring cleavage enzymes, the products of which are metabolized via a common <i>meta</i> fission pathway, resulting in the formation of compounds of central metabolism (see this pathway and MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: TOLUENE-DEG-2-OH-PWY| and |FRAME: TOLUENE-DEG-DIOL-PWY|).   

Toluene degradation in |FRAME: TAX-329 <i>Ralstonia pickettii</i> (previously known as <i>Pseudomonas pickettii</i> and <i>Burkholderia pickettii</i>)\"| is controlled by a chroosomal regulon |CITS: [10671442]|. The initial hydroxylation reactions are catalyzed by toluene 3-monooxygenase, followed by <i>meta</i> cleavage of the benzene ring by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, and subsequent degradation via the <i>meta</i> cleavage pathway (see |FRAME:P183-PWY|) |CITS: [8206853]|.   

There is disagreement in the literature over the hydroxylation reactions of the first enzyme of this pathway. Initial reports suggested that the first hydroxylation is at the <i>meta</i> position yielding <i>m</i>-cresol (3-hydroxytoluene) as an intermediate, and the second yields 2,3-dihydroxytoluene (3-methylcatechol) pathway |CITS: [8206853]|.  However, later work suggested that toluene 3-monooxygenase is a predominantly <i>para</i> cleaving enzyme.  Its initial products were shown in that study to be 90% <i>p</i>-cresol, and 10% <i>m</i>-cresol.  <i>p</i>-Cresol was further hydroxylated to 4-methylcatechol |CITS: [15126473]|. Although further metabolism of 4-methylcatechol was not studied in that report, it has been shown to be a substrate of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in <i>Ralstonia pickettii</i> |CITS: [1856161]|.

Ring fission of 2,3-dihydroxytoluene is catalyzed by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase to produce <i>cis,cis</i>-2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoate.  This compound is hydrolyzed to 2-oxopent-4-enoate, or its tautomeric dienol form <i>cis</i>-2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate.  This tautomerization occurs spontaneously in aqueous solution |CITS: [15301547]|.  It is not known which tautomeric form is produced by the hydrolase, and which form is used by the hydratase of <i>R. pickettii</i> in this pathway.  However, it has been suggested that the |FRAME:TAX-303| hydratase uses the dienol form as a substrate |CITS: [2681159]|, and there is evidence that the |FRAME:TAX-562| hydratase also uses the dienol form as substrate, producing a ketonized intermediate in the reaction mechanism  |CITS: [9492273]|.  The products of the pathway are pyruvate, which enters central metabolism, and acetaldehyde, which may be converted by acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase to acetyl-CoA, a central metabolite, as suggested by work in <i>Pseudomonas</i> |CITS: [8063106], [8419288]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS"	"superpathway of glyoxylate bypass and TCA"	"TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS"	"This superpathway integrates the common prokaryotic TCA cycle with the glyoxylate shunt, a variation that bypasses the steps of the TCA cycle in which carbon is lost in the form of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.


The |FRAME: TCA \"TCA cycle\"| is a catabolic pathway that generates energy and reducing power as well as precursors for biosynthesis. The TCA cycle is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|.

The input to the cycle is |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, which is produced by the |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX \"pyruvate dehydrogenase complex\"| from pyruvate, the product of the ubiquitous glycolysis pathway, but is also generated by the degradation of fats and proteins and by the fermentation of many feedstocks.

In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP.

The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that trasport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes.

This superpathway also includes the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|, which bypasses those steps in the TCA cycle that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|, eliminating the loss of carbon. The glyoxylate cycle operates in bacteria and some eukaryotic organisms. In |FRAME:TAX-562| the bypass is active when growth on 2 carbon compounds requires conservation of 4 carbon TCA intermediates, and is repressed during growth on glucose |CITS: [6378912][6389540][6329757][2512996]|. In plants the cycle is invovled in the metabolism of storage oils during germination of seeds |CITS:[Brownleade97]|. The cycle also operates in developing eggs of nematodes, where it converts triacylglycerols to carbohydrates |CITS: [627278]|."

This superpathway shows the various ways that |FRAME:TAX-562| can obtain pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, a coenzyme for many 
enzymes that participate in amino  acid and glycogen  metabolism. It can be synthesized de novo from 
erythrose-4-phosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phoshpate, and pyruvate |CITS: [12896974], [9696782]|. 
It can also be obtained via salvage pathways from certain precursors, pyridoxal, pyroxidine and pyridoxamine, that 
might be available in the environment |CITS: [323431], [9537380], [8764513]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY0-781"	"aspartate superpathway"	"PWY0-781"	"This superpathway integrates the biosynthesis of several compounds that are derived from the central metabolite |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, an intermediate of the |FRAME:TCA \"TCA cycle\"|, including the amino acids |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, |FRAME: LYS|, |FRAME: THR|, and |FRAME: MET|, as well as the main methyl-group carrier |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| and the proton/electron carrier |FRAME: NAD|. The specific pathways shown here are those used by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562|.

The pathway starts by the reversible transamination of |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID| to |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.6.1.1|, providing a link between carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. |FRAME:OXALACETIC_ACID Oxaloacetate|, which is consumed in this pathway, is replenished from the |FRAME:TCA \"TCA cycle\"|, by |FRAME: EC-6.4.1.1|, and in some bacteria also by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.31| |CITS: [Gottschalk1986]|.

To start |FRAME: NAD| biosynthesis, |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is oxidized by |FRAME: EC-1.4.3.16|, the first enzyme dedicated to <i>de novo</i> |FRAME: NAD| biosynthesis in some bacteria. The enzyme can use either |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| or |FRAME: FUM| as electron acceptor, enabling it to function under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions |CITS: [11863440]|. |FRAME: NAD| biosynthesis proceeds via |FRAME: QUINOLINATE|, |FRAME: NICOTINATE_NUCLEOTIDE|, and |FRAME: DEAMIDO-NAD|, which is aminated to |FRAME: NAD| (see pathway |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|)

|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| can also by converted in two steps to |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE|, where the pathway branches further. One branch leads toward |FRAME: LYS| biosynthesis, while the other continues towards the biosynthesis of |FRAME: THR|, |FRAME: MET|, and |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| |CITS: [14929228]|.

Because the conversion of |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE| is common to many downstream biosynthetic pathways, |FRAME: TAX-562| has three different enzymes that initialize it (|FRAME: ASPKINIHOMOSERDEHYDROGI-CPLX \"aspartate kinase I\"|, |FRAME: ASPKINIIHOMOSERDEHYDROGII-CPLX \"aspartate kinase II\"|, and |FRAME: ASPKINIII-CPLX \"aspartate kinase III\"|), which are controlled by the available supply of |FRAME: THR|, |FRAME: MET| and |FRAME: LYS|, respectively |CITS: [4148765]|.
The L-lysine pathway shown here belongs to the diaminopimelate (DAP) group of Lysine pathways, and is known as the succinylase variant (see |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|, as it involves succinylated intermediates.

The rest of the |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE-SEMIALDEHYDE| is converted to |FRAME: HOMO-SER| by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.3|. Once again, |FRAME: TAX-562| has two different enzymes catalyzing this reaction, which are controlled by the availability of |FRAME: THR| and |FRAME: MET|, respectively |CITS: [4551091][4889171]|.
|FRAME: HOMO-SER| can be isomerized to |FRAME: THR| in two steps that involved phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation |CITS: [11368768]|, or alternatively can lead to the formation of |FRAME: MET| in a 4-step pathway. 

For |FRAME: MET| biosynthesis, homoserine is first activated by <i>O</i>-succinylation, and the product is combined with |FRAME: CYS| to form cystathionine. This compound is cleaved to homocysteine, which is subsequently methylated to produce methionine. The last reaction is catalyzed in |FRAME: TAX-562| by two different enzymes, |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| and |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.14|. Both enzymes use |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| as the methyl donor. However, the former requires cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>), while the latter does not |CITS: [1339288]|.

Once |FRAME: MET| is formed, a single enzyme, the ATP-dependent |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6|, can convert it to |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| |CITS: [6251075]|."

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=MET-SAM-PWY"	"superpathway of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine biosynthesis"	"MET-SAM-PWY"	"This superpathway integrates the biosynthesis of the amino acids |FRAME: HOMO-SER| and |FRAME: MET| from |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, and the single step conversion of |FRAME: MET| to |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. The sub-pathways used for construction of this superpathway are those used by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562|.

|FRAME: MET| (met) is one of the proteinogenic amino acids, but is also required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines.
In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.

In the pathway shown here, |FRAME: MET| is synthesized using organic sulfur through transsulfuration of <i>O</i>-acylated homoserine with |FRAME: CYS| to form |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE|. Cystathionine is then cleaved to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, which is methylated to methionine |CITS: [3309561]|.
The methylation of |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| to |FRAME: MET| is catalyzed by either a cobalamin-independent enzyme (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13 \"EC 2.1.1.13\"|) or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme (|FRAME: EC-2.1.1.14 \"EC 2.1.1.14\"|), depending upon the species or growth conditions |CITS: [9409150][12948640]|.

The <i>O</i>-acyl group of homoserine is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast, and most Gram-positive bacteria (see |FRAME: HSERMETANA-PWY|) and a succinyl group (as shown here) in enteric bacteria and some other Gram-negative bacteria, such as |FRAME: TAX-287| and |FRAME:TAX-303| (|CITS: [3309561][9409150][10482527]|).

Once |FRAME: MET| is formed, a single enzyme, the ATP-dependent |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6|, can convert it to |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) |CITS: [6251075]|. SAM is the principal biological methyl donor in transmethylation reactions, and is also used as a sulfur donor in transsulfuration reactions, as an aminopropyl group donor in polyamine biosynthesis, and as a cofactor of many enzymes that use radical chemistry by generating a |FRAME: CPD-15400|."

|FRAME: Ubiquinones Ubiquinone| (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in membranes. In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (<i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex). The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate|, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via either a |FRAME: MEP-Pathways \"\"methylerythritol phosphate pathway\"| or a |FRAME: Mevalonate-Pathways \"mevalonate pathway\"|, which feed isoprene units into the |FRAME: Polyprenyl-Biosynthesis| pathways.

The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example, |FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 such subunits, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10. The ubiquinones are often named according to the number of carbons in the side chain (e.g. ubi-30) or the number of isoprenoid subunits (e.g. Q-10).

Following addition of the polyprenyl tail, the product (4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate), is processed in three steps, namely decarboxylation, oxidation, and methylation. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways differ in the order of these steps: in eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated prior to decarboxylation; in prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation and methylation |CITS: [Shepherd96]|.

The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that accumulate pathway intermediates; some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

|FRAME: UBIQUINONE-8| (Q-8) is a common form of ubiquinone among bacteria. Most of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, such as the enterobacteria, produce Q-8 (in addition to |FRAME: CPD-9728| and |FRAME: DEMETHYLMENAQUINONE|). Q-8 has been documented in several strains of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [13673033]|,
|FRAME: TAX-546|, |FRAME: TAX-548|, |FRAME: TAX-554|, |FRAME: TAX-584|, |FRAME: TAX-585| |CITS: [4886765]| and |FRAME: TAX-615| |CITS: [Bezborodov69]|, as well as in the non-eneterobacteria |FRAME: TAX-644|, |FRAME: TAX-648| |CITS: [4886765]| and |FRAME: TAX-51367| |CITS: [Collins81]|. It is also common in aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-354| |CITS:[13673033] [4288128]|, |FRAME: TAX-353| |CITS: [13869492]|, |FRAME: TAX-107673| |CITS: [Denis75]|, |FRAME: TAX-520| |CITS: [4351160]|, |FRAME: TAX-106590| |CITS: [Yamada68]|, and various
|FRAME: TAX-338| strains |CITS: [Ikemoto80]|. Q-8 was also found to be the major quinone in an unidentified strain of the gliding bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1021| |CITS: [Carr67]| and in some phototrophic bacteria, including |FRAME:TAX-1049|
|CITS:[14240125]|, |FRAME:TAX-1053|, |FRAME: TAX-28068| |CITS: [Carr65][5727384]|, and a strain of |FRAME: TAX-1081| |CITS: [5727384]|. Q-8 is often found as a secondary quinone in |FRAME: TAX-286| strains |CITS: [4886765]|.

The best studied ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway is that of |FRAME: TAX-83333|, which produces a |FRAME: UBIQUINONE-8|. The first committed step of the pathway is the conversion of chorismate to |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate|
by |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER|. The enzyme retains and is efficiently inhibited by the product of the reaction, 4-hydroxybenzoate, which may present a control mechanism for the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway or a mechanism for delivery of 4-hydroxybenzoate to the membrane |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.

The second step in the pathway is the transfer of the polyisoprenoid tail onto |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate| by the membrane-bound |FRAME: 4OHBENZOATE-OCTAPRENYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|. This is followed by the
decarboxylation of the ring structure by |FRAME: CPLX0-301| (or possibly by UbiX) to form |FRAME: 2-OCTAPRENYLPHENOL|.  Under anaerobic conditions, this compound accumulates in the membrane and is not converted into ubiquinone. Further steps in the pathway require the presence of dioxygen |CITS: [361395]|.

Following is the alternating introduction of three hydroxyl- and three methyl groups. With the exception of the methyltransferase that catalyzes both of the <i>O</i>-methyltransferase reactions, UbiG, none of the enzymes have been studied biochemically and their substrate and cofactor requirements are still unknown.

The enzymes of this pathway may form a membrane-associated complex |CITS: [393264]|. UbiX shows a genetic interaction with UbiG, suggesting a possible physical interaction within a complex |CITS: [16923914]|.

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 \"ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase\"|.

The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 

Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.

The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

As shown in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7199|, the deoxyribonucleosides are imported into the cell and phosphorylated by deoxyribonucleoside kinases at the 5' position. The monophosphates are then phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis, as described in this pathway. 

|FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 \"dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)\"|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 \"bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)\"| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 \"(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)\"|.

Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 \"nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)\"|."

Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.

In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

<b>About This Pathway</b>

The pathway shown here illustrates the most common route in which pyrimidine ribonucleotides (|FRAME: CDP| and |FRAME: UDP|) are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, and the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed. It is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.

Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 \"EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase\"|. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, |FRAME: UMP|, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to |FRAME: UDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DUDP|. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed <i>de novo</i>, |FRAME: CTP|, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to |FRAME: CDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DCDP|.

Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 \"thymidylate synthase, EC 2.1.1.45\"| (some organisms have an alternative enzyme, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6545|).
The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, |FRAME: DUDP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form before it can be reduced/methylated. This is achieved in two steps - phosphorylation to |FRAME: DUTP|, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.

Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: HS11626-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: CPLX66-1052|.

In organisms that contain the enzyme |FRAME: DCTP-DEAM-CPLX| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 EC 3.5.4.13\"|), a second route forms |FRAME: DUMP| from |FRAME: DCDP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7187|)."

Unlike the Gram-positives, which have a thick |FRAME: Peptidoglycans \"peptidoglycan\"| layer, the Gram-negatives have a single layer of peptidoglycan between the inner and
outer lipid bilayer membranes, but their surface is covered with lipopolysaccharides. The presence of LPS in the outer membrane confers stability to the bacterial membrane, protection against bacteriophages and the action of certain antibiotics, as well as protection against the host defence mechanism during infections.

LPS is composed of a lipid moiety (lipid A) that anchors the molecule in the outer membrane, and a polysaccharide moiety that extends out of the cell wall. The polysaccharide moiety is further divided into the core, which is an oligosaccharide consisting of an inner and outer region, and a distal repeating unit known as O-antigen. 

The O-specific chain is the part of the LPS that shows the largest variation between species and the part that evokes a specific immune response. Some bacteria do not produce an O-antigen at all (the LPS of these organisms is called rough-type, because these bacteria produce colonies with rough edges when growing on agar plates).

All O-antigens are attached to the core and consist of repeated oligosaccharide units.

|FRAME:TAX-562| K12 produces an O-antigen composed of four sugars: glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose and rhamnose.  

This pathway depicts the synthesis of three of these sugars. UDP-galactose is transformed from its pyranose form to its furanose form. dTTP glucose-1-phosphate is derivatized to dTDP-rhamnose. Fructose-6-phosphate gains an amino group,
incorporates an acetate moiety and then acquires a nucleoside diphosphate resulting in UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
During formation of the repeat unit, the nucleoside diphosphates are removed.

The repeat unit is polymerized and attached to the outer core. Formation and polymerization of the O-antigen repeat unit is not shown here |CITS: [7517391] [7512872] [ColiSalII]|.

"HTTPS://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=GLYCOLYSIS-TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS"	"superpathway of glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase, TCA, and glyoxylate bypass"	"GLYCOLYSIS-TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS"	"This superpathway integrates some of the fundumental components of energy metabolism, starting with a hexose sugar and ending with |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and several forms of highly reducing metabolites that can be used for ATP generation.

The first component in the superpathway is the |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS gycolysis| pathway. Glycolysis is essential under all conditions of growth because it produces many of the key precursor metabolites that are essential for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules. Due to its importance, glycolysis can be found in almost all organisms.

Glycolysis fulfills two essential functions:

i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and

ii) it can produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules by running in the reverse direction.

Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy. The glycolysis pathway used in this superpathway is the well characterized glycolysis pathway of the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562| growing with |FRAME: D-Glucose| as a source of carbon and energy (glucose is phosphorylated by the phosphotransferase system that import it into the cell, and thus the pathway starts with |FRAME: D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate|).

The final product of glycolysis, |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, is converted to |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| by the action of the |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX \"pyruvate dehydrogenase complex\"|. This is a key reaction of central metabolism, as it links the substrate-level phosphorylation glycolysis pathway with the |FRAME: TCA \"TCA cycle\"|, which accepts the input of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|.

The |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX|, which in |FRAME:TAX-562| consists of 24 E1 subunits, 24 E2 subunits, and 12 E3 subunits, catalyzes three reactions that constitute a cycle, which is described in the pathway |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|.  The three reactions can be summarized by the reaction

|FRAME:PYRUVDEH-RXN|.

The product of the complex, |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|, feeds into the TCA cycle, a catabolic pathway that generates energy and reducing power as well as precursors for biosynthesis. The TCA cycle is very common, and a variation of it exists in practically all aerobic living organisms |CITS: [16746397][16746585][16747930]|.

Even though |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| is shown in this superpathway as a product of the glycolysis pathway, it is also generated by the degradation of fats and proteins and by the fermentation of many metabolites..

In every turn the TCA cycle converts one molecule of |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| into two |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| molecules, reduces a total of four molecules of either |FRAME: NAD|, |FRAME: NADP|, or |FRAME: Quinones quinone| to |FRAME: NADH|, |FRAME: NADPH| and |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinol|, respectively, and phosphorylates one molecule of GDP to GTP.

The reduced molecules of NADH/NADPH/quinol that are formed by the TCA cycle serve as electron donors for oxidative phosphorylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-3781|). In that process the electrons flow to a terminal acceptor, powering on their way proton pumps that trasport protons across the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial membranes, generating a proton motive force (PMF). As the protons return to their original location, they power ATPase enzymes that phosphorylate ADP molecules to ATP. The total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 ATP molecules in eukaryotes.

Finally, this superpathway includes the |FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|, which bypasses those steps in the TCA cycle that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|, eliminating the loss of carbon. The glyoxylate cycle operates in bacteria and some eukaryotic organisms. In |FRAME:TAX-562| the bypass is active when growth on 2 carbon compounds requires conservation of 4 carbon TCA intermediates, and is repressed during growth on glucose |CITS: [6378912][6389540][6329757][2512996]|. In plants the cycle is invovled in the metabolism of storage oils during germination of seeds |CITS:[Brownleade97]|. The cycle also operates in developing eggs of nematodes, where it converts triacylglycerols to carbohydrates |CITS: [627278]|."
